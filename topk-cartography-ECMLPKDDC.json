            "The paper first talks about the current state of learning machine learning and the challenges software engineers face when learning machine learning",
            "The authors suggest hyperparameter tuning,  data splitting, and gradient signals are the main topics to learn.",
            "Authors designed specific exercises to help students learn hyperparameter tuning, data splitting, and gradient signals.",
            "Specific exercises can be used not just for software engineers, but for anyone with an engineering or quantitative background.",
            "Explanations of the exercises and what they provide to students are clear.",
            "The entire paper is based on the observation \"We noted that especially computer science and software engineering students tended to struggle with the adoption of an empirical mindset rather than a constructive one.\" While it sounds reasonable, there are no additional examples or details explaining how software engineers struggle or why.",
            "It's not clear how the authors chose hyperparameter tuning,  data splitting, and gradient signals as the main topics",
            "There's no quantitative difference provided showing the effectiveness of the results provided",
            "It would have been even nicer if there was a way to compare it to existing teaching methods.",
            "The authors of this submission identified three major attention points of ML teaching when introducing the topic to software engineering students",
            "Those principles are taught with the help of self created jupyter notebooks, providing an interactive widget for a simple linear regression problem for visualizing the effect of different learning rates, the proper use of data splitting for hyperparameter tuning and an example implementation of automatic differentiation.",
            "This identifies areas which probably need to be addressed better in future design of teaching materials.",
            "Also, the authors invested great efforts in the very readable design of small toy classes showing how backpropagation via autodiff can be implemented",
            "I assume this will be of great value for understanding the working principles of large frameworks like pytorch or tensorflow, especially for software engineering students.",
            "On the other hand, I think that such a code-heavy approach might not be directly transferable to different audiences which might be less familiar with programming or software design.",
            "Moreover, even though I agree that using jupyter notebooks has become a frequently used and pretty much standard way for teaching and demonstration within the data science community, I doubt that the authors used it as their only means of teaching in ML classes and they could have elaborated a bit on how they encapsulate their notebooks into their regular teaching",
            "But maybe that had to be left out due to paper space restrictions.",
            "This work focuses on teaching Machine Learning (ML) to Software Engineers (SE)",
            "There is a need for change of thought process between SE and ML due to constructive and empirical mindset",
            "Authors specifically focused on three aspects of ML, namely, 1",
            "To address these challenges, authors created materials which explains the underlying concepts and how they differ from SE",
            "* Materials are self-explanatory and useful for all students over and beyond SE students",

            "Generating the figures in either \u201cpdf\u201d or \u201ceps\u201d format might retain the figure quality",
            "This paper presents a web application for learning decision trees (referred to as DTs throughout the paper) as well as their nuances",
            "The authors do an excellent job situating why learning decision trees is important",
            "Similar if the intended audience has a background in computer science, how does this tool use and/or enhance one's computer science training?\u00a0",
            "Additionally, I would have liked to see a connection to how this tool fits into a machine learning course",
            "For example, is this a student's first or second contact with the material? Do students use this tool to inform pseudocode drafts?\u00a0",
            "I can see the potential of the tool introduced here to teach and explain the very basics of decision trees (and how to evaluate classifiers).",
            "I'm not sure it is entirely finished -- the \"Hint\" functionality did not do anything, as far as I could make out, and best practice for UI design for this kind of interactive tutorial would be to have documentation in the form of tooltips right inside the app.",
            "How to find optimal *binary* splits is much easier to explain/understand and the resulting tree structures are easier to follow as well",
            "This tool only aids in the visual explanation of very simple decision tree topics, which, in my teaching experience, only rarely cause confusion or issues in the classroom, namely the basic \"greedy\" recursive split search and how to use the tree to classify new data",
            "This seems like a wasted opportunity and limits the utility of the proposed tool-- more challenging and practically very important topics that learners often struggle with in my experience, like, e.g., pruning trees to avoid overfitting, how surrogate splits work, the instability of tree structure to small data perturbations,  etc, are not covered by the functionality of the tool.",
            "This tool is not based on any of the popular ML frameworks in R or Python, which seems another wasted teachingg opportunity",
            "If it were, this would allow students to also see the code generating the respective model and thereby learn to relate theoretical concepts to the corresponding implementation features.",
            "The authors explain their motivations, demonstrate a societal need for a solution, and also showcase previous methods used like class of clans.",
            "For example, the authors believe the original Iris dataset was created with benchmarking in mind, not learning",
            "The episodes and intended learning outcomes section is also well organized into specific topics",
            "The topics themselves are also good introductory topics for teaching machine learning.",
            "While that's important to include, I would have preferred to see the outcomes of using such a teaching method",
            "The authors present a self designed introductory teaching lesson of about 3 to 4 hours to convey the principles and workings of some of the fundamental aspects of ML: feature engineering,",
            "KNN and logistic regression as classification methods and performance evaluation in a playful manner using chocolate and candy as a practical toy dataset and additional motivator.",
            "Their approach follows the guidelines of the Carpentries and aims to develop intuition for ML, bridging the gap between the two most dominant ML teaching styles which either are primarily focussed on",
            "theory and might provide a daunting entry barrier on the one hand, or aim at quick implementation and application of ML algorithms without detailed knowledge of the inner workings on the other hand.",
            "Also, the authors put strong focus early on to discuss ethical issues of machine learning and encourage lesson participants to think critically about adoption of ML approaches for given problems which is a strong plus in my opinion and often not emphasized enough in existing tutorials.",
            "I would be very curious to learn how lesson participants respond to this approach",
            "Unfortunately, the authors only present their teaching procedure without giving details on how well their approach worked in practice (however that could be measured...), how participants",
            "Unfortunately, author identification became possible through that and the review can no longer be considered completely \"blind\".",
            "Nevertheless, I suggest accepting the submission since the approach is innovative and will probably invoke interesting discussions among participants.",
            "This work addresses the middle ground between math-heavy foundational and application-focused black-box Machine Learning (ML) teaching styles",

            "These aspects are useful for AI experts teaching this topic and could improve the experience for all kinds of learners",
            "The collected qualitative feedback is interesting and helpful to improve the content of the training",
