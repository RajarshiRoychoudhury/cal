11,3," Instead of merely defining an architecture as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), with nodes corresponding to feature maps and edges to primitive operations, the approach in this paper introduces a hierarchy of architectures of this form."
12,3,"\n5. In the conclusion, it claims the system is efficient in helping current model. What do you mean by \""efficient\""?"
13,3, My main concern is the underlying assumption (if I understand correctly) that the adversarial attack technique that the detector has to handle needs to be available at the training time of the detector.
14,3, The proposed GAN generator consists of two components where one focuses on generating foreground while the other focuses on generating background.

116,3,\n\nThe proposed concept is only analyzed in MLP with Sigmoid activation function.
117,2,"The authors are perpetuating misguided generalizations in the face of substantial
experimental data to the contrary"
118,3,  It seems because of other factors instead of the stochastic convolutional layer.
119,3, Can the authors comment on how difficult it will be to add functions to the list in Table 2 to handle the other 15 tasks? Or is NGM strictly for extractive QA?
120,3,\n\n4. The hypothesis are not correctly specified.
