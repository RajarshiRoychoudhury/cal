674,1," \n\nInterestingly, one aspect of the proposed approach that seems to indeed be an improvement over random options is made visible by a strategy used by the authors to circumvent computational constraints. As explained in the second paragraph of page 8, instead of learning policies to maximize the pseudo-rewards associated with eigenoptions the authors used a myopic policy that only looks one step ahead (which is the same as having a policy learned with a discount factor of zero). [[CNT], [EMP-NEU], [DIS], [MIN]]The fact that these myopic policies are able to navigate to specific locations and stay there suggests that the proposed approach gives rise to dense pseudo-rewards that are very informative."

8828,1, The experimental results also look promising.
8829,3, I also have the following questions regarding the theoretical contributions:\n\n(A) The authors emphasize the logarithmic dependence on T.
8830,3, But adversarial images should be visually undistinguishable from original images.
8831,3,\n\nBaselines: why is Shin et al. (2017) not included as one of the baselines?
8832,3,  MLE-based methods penalize syntactically different but semantically equivalent programs.
8833,1,"\n\n(2) Authors use figures that are easy to understand to explain their core idea, i.e., maintaining a vector which estimates the row norm of weight matrix and implicitly normalizing weights."
8834,3," Visual concepts were introduced in Wang et al. 2015, which are clustering centers of feature vectors in a lattice of a CNN."
8835,3,\n\n- Have you tried to multiply the isotropic normal noise with the learned singular values and generate images from  this new prior  and compute inceptions scores etc?
8836,3," However, one is allowed to use any noise distribution in NCE, and convergence should be quicker with those distributions that are close to the true distribution."
8837,3," While previous approaches assumes the order of shared layers are the same between tasks, this paper assume the order can vary across tasks, and the (soft) order is learned during training."
8838,3," Indeed the functional model considered in the linear case is very similar to Eq. 2.5 or Eq. 3.2. Moreover, extension to nonparametric/nonlinear situations were also studied."
8839,3,"\nThe subtleness of this work over most other video prediction work is that it isn't conditioned on a labeled latent space (like text to video prediction, for example)."
8840,3,"""The authors present a deep neural network that evaluates plate numbers."

8875,3,\nI would also be great to have intuitions on why a single continuous filter works betters\nthan 20 discrete ones (if this behaviour is consistent accross initialization).
8876,3,\n\nThe paper closely follows Hein and Andriushchenko (2017).
8877,3, The main contribution is to introduce active learning principles for sampling the sequential tasks in an online algorithm.
8878,3,  One way to analyze whether this happens is to predict the identity of the task from the hidden vectors.

11180,3,"""This paper presents a method to search neural network architectures at the same time of training."
11181,3,"\n\nFurther in this direction, Section 4.1 claims \u201cZero partial derivatives are ignored to make the signal more clear"
11182,1," \n\nThe affect lexical seems to be a very interesting resource (although I'm not sure what it means to call it 'state of the art'), and definitely support the endeavour to make language models more reflective of complex semantic and pragmatic phenomena such as affect and sentiment."
11183,3,"Unfortunately, the results of the NMT experiments are not particularly compelling, with overall gains over baseline NMT being between 0.6 and 0.8 BLEU."
11184,3,"  They use a prior model proposed in Finn et al. 2016, make several incremental architectural improvements, and use an adversarial loss function instead of an L2 loss."
11185,3," In other words, how structured is this prior and does it really give us some of the interesting properties of deep neural networks, or is it mostly a cute mathematical trick?"
11186,3,"  The paper claims that the exponential has been noted to be ad-hoc, please provide a reference for this."
11187,1,\n\nThis is a well-written paper with interesting (and potentially useful) insights.
11188,3," Also, the matching part, which is discussed at the theoretical level, could be better explained and presented at a more visual level."
11189,2,"Publishing a weak paper can be a bit like kissing someone through a screen door - it might feel good for a moment, but what does it actually accomplish?"
11190,1,"\n\n-\tThe paper shows how state of the art relational networks, performing well on multiple relational tasks, fail to generalize to same-ness relationships,"
11191,3," Thus, if we can learn the SRs, we can extend the proposed approach to the nonlinear case"
11192,3,"""This paper presents a method for classifying Tumblr posts with associated images according to associated single emotion word hashtags."
11193,3," I still think the novelty, significance of the claims and protocol are still perhaps borderline for publication (though I'm leaning towards acceptance),"
11194,3,\nAnother thought on this: is it possible to integrate the trigram occurrence with summarization reward?
11195,1," \n\nPage 8:\n-\tThe results in general indicate that the method is much better than chance,"
11196,3," 2015.\n\n[2] Lee, Chen-Yu, et al."
11197,3,"  First, besides the GloVe common crawl embeddings used here, there are several other embedding sets (including the other GloVe embeddings released along with the ones used here, and the Google News word2vec embeddings) that should be considered."
11198,3," This method presents a family that can span the entire space, but the efficient parts of this family (which give the promised speedup) only span a tiny fraction of it, as they require only O(log(N)) params to specify an O(N^2) unitary matrix."
11199,3, 2) it\u2019s hard to imagine datasets that have exact but unknown matches (I welcome the authors to put forward some such scenarios);
11200,1," While it might be hard to compare to this approach directly in experiments, it would still be good to mention this work and discuss how it relates to the current paper."
11201,3," As a result, although there are approaches taken to generate unbalanced datasets out of them (e.g. MNIST)."
11202,3,". In addition, it would be better to have some analysis on the end-to-end runtime efficiency and the effectiveness of the placements"
11203,3, \n\nA few questions:\n(1). The author may want to check whether (8) can be called a Bayes decision rule.
11204,1," The baseline definition is well-motivated, and the benefits offered by it are quantified intuitively. "
11205,3,Certain gating in RNN is very useful but I don't know whether one can train any reasonable RNN with all multiplicative gates
11206,1," This is an interesting phenomenon and deservers further study, as currently doing the \u201cwrong\u201d things is better than doing the \u201cright\u201d thing."
11207,1," While\nresults are pretty good,"
