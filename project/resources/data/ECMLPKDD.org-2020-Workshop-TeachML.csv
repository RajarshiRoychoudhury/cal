0,The paper first talks about the current state of learning machine learning and the challenges software engineers face when learning machine learning,jm5E97TTMEb
1,"The authors suggest hyperparameter tuning,  data splitting, and gradient signals are the main topics to learn.",jm5E97TTMEb
2,"Authors designed specific exercises to help students learn hyperparameter tuning, data splitting, and gradient signals.",jm5E97TTMEb
3,"Specific exercises can be used not just for software engineers, but for anyone with an engineering or quantitative background.",jm5E97TTMEb
4,Explanations of the exercises and what they provide to students are clear.,jm5E97TTMEb
5,"The entire paper is based on the observation ""We noted that especially computer science and software engineering students tended to struggle with the adoption of an empirical mindset rather than a constructive one."" While it sounds reasonable, there are no additional examples or details explaining how software engineers struggle or why.",jm5E97TTMEb
6,"It's not clear how the authors chose hyperparameter tuning,  data splitting, and gradient signals as the main topics",jm5E97TTMEb
7,Why are these more important than learning about model architectures and their applications?,jm5E97TTMEb
8,There's no quantitative difference provided showing the effectiveness of the results provided,jm5E97TTMEb
9,I would have liked to see pre-test and post-test scores of students based on this teaching method,jm5E97TTMEb
10,It would have been even nicer if there was a way to compare it to existing teaching methods.,jm5E97TTMEb
11,The authors of this submission identified three major attention points of ML teaching when introducing the topic to software engineering students,jm5E97TTMEb
12,proper data splitting and knowledge of gradient computations and workings of backpropagation.,jm5E97TTMEb
13,"Those principles are taught with the help of self created jupyter notebooks, providing an interactive widget for a simple linear regression problem for visualizing the effect of different learning rates, the proper use of data splitting for hyperparameter tuning and an example implementation of automatic differentiation.",jm5E97TTMEb
14,"What I really liked about the paper is that the authors reported first hand experiences of their students using this approach, including what went wrong in many cases",jm5E97TTMEb
15,"Unsurprisingly, this seemed to have been the part about proper data splitting",jm5E97TTMEb
16,This identifies areas which probably need to be addressed better in future design of teaching materials.,jm5E97TTMEb
17,"Also, the authors invested great efforts in the very readable design of small toy classes showing how backpropagation via autodiff can be implemented",jm5E97TTMEb
18,"I assume this will be of great value for understanding the working principles of large frameworks like pytorch or tensorflow, especially for software engineering students.",jm5E97TTMEb
19,"On the other hand, I think that such a code-heavy approach might not be directly transferable to different audiences which might be less familiar with programming or software design.",jm5E97TTMEb
20,"Moreover, even though I agree that using jupyter notebooks has become a frequently used and pretty much standard way for teaching and demonstration within the data science community, I doubt that the authors used it as their only means of teaching in ML classes and they could have elaborated a bit on how they encapsulate their notebooks into their regular teaching",jm5E97TTMEb
21,But maybe that had to be left out due to paper space restrictions.,jm5E97TTMEb
22,This work focuses on teaching Machine Learning (ML) to Software Engineers (SE),jm5E97TTMEb
23,There is a need for change of thought process between SE and ML due to constructive and empirical mindset,jm5E97TTMEb
24,"Authors specifically focused on three aspects of ML, namely, 1",jm5E97TTMEb
25,"To address these challenges, authors created materials which explains the underlying concepts and how they differ from SE",jm5E97TTMEb
26,Authors report various findings on the effectiveness of the materials and teaching methodology on the group of students.,jm5E97TTMEb
27,* Materials are self-explanatory and useful for all students over and beyond SE students,jm5E97TTMEb
28,* Motivation on each material is well thought out and described very succinctly,jm5E97TTMEb
29,"* I found the description on the 3rd material is a bit lacking on the self-explanation part compared to the other two materials, although the code is written well with sufficient comments in all",jm5E97TTMEb
30,* A little more detail on the “normal equation” might be helpful for comparison to students who are not aware of it,jm5E97TTMEb
31,* Small suggestion: Resolution of Fig,jm5E97TTMEb
32,Generating the figures in either “pdf” or “eps” format might retain the figure quality,jm5E97TTMEb
33,This paper presents a web application for learning decision trees (referred to as DTs throughout the paper) as well as their nuances,aLdr-6rFn5j
34,The authors do an excellent job situating why learning decision trees is important,aLdr-6rFn5j
35,"The web application is well explained from the students perspective, but I would have liked a few more details on the instructor's perspective. ",aLdr-6rFn5j
36,There are a few elements of the paper that feel a bit disjointed,aLdr-6rFn5j
37,"For example, the paper spends considerable space on the ""tennis data set"" but yet the default data set for the web application concerns monsters",aLdr-6rFn5j
38,"Similar if the intended audience has a background in computer science, how does this tool use and/or enhance one's computer science training? ",aLdr-6rFn5j
39,"Additionally, I would have liked to see a connection to how this tool fits into a machine learning course",aLdr-6rFn5j
40,"For example, is this a student's first or second contact with the material? Do students use this tool to inform pseudocode drafts? ",aLdr-6rFn5j
41,* Well designed tool for learning and understanding the nuances of decision trees,aLdr-6rFn5j
42,* Thoughtful presentation of the web application and strong motivation for learning about decision trees,aLdr-6rFn5j
43,* Some issues with the structure of the current draft ,aLdr-6rFn5j
44,* Missing explicit placement into a machine learning course,aLdr-6rFn5j
45,I can see the potential of the tool introduced here to teach and explain the very basics of decision trees (and how to evaluate classifiers).,aLdr-6rFn5j
46,"I'm not sure it is entirely finished -- the ""Hint"" functionality did not do anything, as far as I could make out, and best practice for UI design for this kind of interactive tutorial would be to have documentation in the form of tooltips right inside the app.",aLdr-6rFn5j
47,I think the decision to use a non-binary decision tree algorithm like ID3 is suboptimal from a didactic point of view,aLdr-6rFn5j
48,How to find optimal *binary* splits is much easier to explain/understand and the resulting tree structures are easier to follow as well,aLdr-6rFn5j
49,"This tool only aids in the visual explanation of very simple decision tree topics, which, in my teaching experience, only rarely cause confusion or issues in the classroom, namely the basic ""greedy"" recursive split search and how to use the tree to classify new data",aLdr-6rFn5j
50,"This seems like a wasted opportunity and limits the utility of the proposed tool-- more challenging and practically very important topics that learners often struggle with in my experience, like, e.g., pruning trees to avoid overfitting, how surrogate splits work, the instability of tree structure to small data perturbations,  etc, are not covered by the functionality of the tool.",aLdr-6rFn5j
51,"This tool is not based on any of the popular ML frameworks in R or Python, which seems another wasted teachingg opportunity",aLdr-6rFn5j
52,"If it were, this would allow students to also see the code generating the respective model and thereby learn to relate theoretical concepts to the corresponding implementation features.",aLdr-6rFn5j
53,"The authors explain their motivations, demonstrate a societal need for a solution, and also showcase previous methods used like class of clans.",a37DEwWs1wu
54,The paper's idea of using candy as a hands-on machine learning teaching method is novel,a37DEwWs1wu
55,"Overall, the paper communicates a variety of the author's unique perspectives",a37DEwWs1wu
56,"For example, the authors believe the original Iris dataset was created with benchmarking in mind, not learning",a37DEwWs1wu
57,The episodes and intended learning outcomes section is also well organized into specific topics,a37DEwWs1wu
58,The topics themselves are also good introductory topics for teaching machine learning.,a37DEwWs1wu
59,"While paper starts strong, the conclusion is weak",a37DEwWs1wu
60,"Before the conclusion, the author explains the motivations and ideas to teach machine learning using candy",a37DEwWs1wu
61,The conclusion simply states there's an ethics component included,a37DEwWs1wu
62,"While that's important to include, I would have preferred to see the outcomes of using such a teaching method",a37DEwWs1wu
63,"Without that, this paper feels incomplete.",a37DEwWs1wu
64,"The authors present a self designed introductory teaching lesson of about 3 to 4 hours to convey the principles and workings of some of the fundamental aspects of ML: feature engineering,",a37DEwWs1wu
65,KNN and logistic regression as classification methods and performance evaluation in a playful manner using chocolate and candy as a practical toy dataset and additional motivator.,a37DEwWs1wu
66,"Their approach follows the guidelines of the Carpentries and aims to develop intuition for ML, bridging the gap between the two most dominant ML teaching styles which either are primarily focussed on",a37DEwWs1wu
67,"theory and might provide a daunting entry barrier on the one hand, or aim at quick implementation and application of ML algorithms without detailed knowledge of the inner workings on the other hand.",a37DEwWs1wu
68,I like the hands-on approach suggested here which teaches basic principles by a very plausible example,a37DEwWs1wu
69,"Also, the authors put strong focus early on to discuss ethical issues of machine learning and encourage lesson participants to think critically about adoption of ML approaches for given problems which is a strong plus in my opinion and often not emphasized enough in existing tutorials.",a37DEwWs1wu
70,I would be very curious to learn how lesson participants respond to this approach,a37DEwWs1wu
71,"Unfortunately, the authors only present their teaching procedure without giving details on how well their approach worked in practice (however that could be measured...), how participants",a37DEwWs1wu
72,"reacted, what they had problems with, etc",a37DEwWs1wu
73,Also I am missing a clear definition of the target audience that course was designed for,a37DEwWs1wu
74,"As an additional (but less important) point: as much as I enjoy candy myself and understand the authors picked it for their motivational value, maybe replacing it with a more healthy alternative would be something to think about.",a37DEwWs1wu
75,The authors provide their teaching materials as a github repository which is great and allows direct adoption,a37DEwWs1wu
76,"Unfortunately, author identification became possible through that and the review can no longer be considered completely ""blind"".",a37DEwWs1wu
77,"Nevertheless, I suggest accepting the submission since the approach is innovative and will probably invoke interesting discussions among participants.",a37DEwWs1wu
78,This work addresses the middle ground between math-heavy foundational and application-focused black-box Machine Learning (ML) teaching styles,a37DEwWs1wu
79,Authors proposed a fun active learning strategy to understand ML concepts and ethical decision processes using candies,a37DEwWs1wu
80,The proposed 10 episode strategy along with their expected learning outcomes are publicly available,a37DEwWs1wu
81,Authors found their strategy to be useful for not only for undergraduates but individuals from all ages.,a37DEwWs1wu
82,"* Very well-motivated paper, there is clearly a need for this kind of teaching style to democratize ML",a37DEwWs1wu
83,* Proposed strategies along with the learning outcomes are thoughtful and effective,a37DEwWs1wu
84,* Prerecorded data is made available with support for the virtual format,a37DEwWs1wu
85,* Authors mentioned the strategy was effective across all ages,a37DEwWs1wu
86,I wonder the effectiveness of teaching with candies for varying age groups,a37DEwWs1wu
87,Young children might be too tempted by the candies than actually learning,a37DEwWs1wu
88,"On the other hand, Older people might get disinterested because they might feel candies are too distracting",a37DEwWs1wu
89,Any exploration on the effectiveness of learning across ages will be valuable.,a37DEwWs1wu
90,"* Proper use of this teaching style will definitely be effective to instil critical thinking and improve the public perception towards ML as not a black box, I commend the authors on that.",a37DEwWs1wu
91,* I would love to see how a few of the episodes are actually described in more detail within the paper but I understand there’s so much information that can be crammed into 4 pages.,a37DEwWs1wu
92,This paper reports experiences with teaching machine learning topics to library staff,CF_7wpDpCmp
93,The authors describe very well the motivation to apply machine learning technology to the collected knowledge of the libraries,CF_7wpDpCmp
94,The idea to spark interest in non-technical staff by teaching them programming and machine learning topics is appealing,CF_7wpDpCmp
95,"However, the question remains if this approach is beneficial in the long term as there is a steep learning curve for beginners to develop correct and working AI projects",CF_7wpDpCmp
96,"The four main takeaways as they are described in the paper, all seem relevant and reasonable",CF_7wpDpCmp
97,These aspects are useful for AI experts teaching this topic and could improve the experience for all kinds of learners,CF_7wpDpCmp
98,The collected qualitative feedback is interesting and helpful to improve the content of the training,CF_7wpDpCmp
99,Yet quantitative data would also be interesting to answer questions,CF_7wpDpCmp
100,"For example, if the training attendees could apply the new knowledge in their daily work",CF_7wpDpCmp
101,"As a person that also teaches ML, I would have liked to read more about the structure and the content of the workshops",CF_7wpDpCmp
102,The described ideas are interesting but very general.,CF_7wpDpCmp
103,"Typo Line 185, Row 2 ""a conversation group conversation""",CF_7wpDpCmp
104,The paper summaries the authors' findings on introducing staff of academic libraries to AI,CF_7wpDpCmp
105,"This problem is, in many ways, domain specific as many obvious applications of AI can be identified in advance (as opposed to designing a curriculum for CS students which cannot make such assumptions)",CF_7wpDpCmp
106,"Having said that, knowledge discovery strikes at the very heart of what AI should be used to do and I felt the paper presented some very interesting ideas.",CF_7wpDpCmp
107,The authors present findings from two training experiences aimed at beginners in two different venues.,CF_7wpDpCmp
108,The collaborative experience in the conference workshop setting is an interesting idea and one that deserves follow-up,CF_7wpDpCmp
109,"The audience, despite the challenges with catering to a diverse set of people, seems to have responded positively to the training offered",CF_7wpDpCmp
110,This seems to be evidenced by an overwhelming positive response,CF_7wpDpCmp
111,"However, the number of participants (and their backgrounds) would help place this better in context.",CF_7wpDpCmp
112,The experience with the local AI groups likewise seems to have built positively on top of a general introduction to AI,CF_7wpDpCmp
113,"This, in itself, is hardly surprising; it would be more interesting to see the medium- and long-term effects of these trainings",CF_7wpDpCmp
114,"For instance, interviews with course participants some months down the line to see if they were able to incorporate some of the introduced topics into their daily workflows or whether they were able to follow through on the collaborative projects mentioned by them",CF_7wpDpCmp
115,I would also encourage the authors to consider metrics that can be used to quantify the results of their experiments in a data-driven way that goes beyond qualitative results.,CF_7wpDpCmp
116,The paper discusses how to teach AI in the context of libraries,CF_7wpDpCmp
117,It discusses two trainings that were implemented and evaluate what learners thought about the courses and what the take aways are from the learner's feedback.,CF_7wpDpCmp
118,"I found the paper very inspiring and fitting for this workshop as it not only describes who the authors teach AI and ML, but also reflects on practices and how it can be done better such that the learners get the most out of the learning experience",CF_7wpDpCmp
119,A well written paper with interesting examples,CF_7wpDpCmp
120,"Although it is focused on teaching library employees, I believe the learnings are applicable to a broader audience",CF_7wpDpCmp
121,I even leared a lot from the references (Elements of AI),CF_7wpDpCmp
122,In particular the takeaways were interesting to me and probably will be to others,CF_7wpDpCmp
123,"I will aim to focus my teaching ""around the uses, benefits, an potential harms of the technology"", as the authors suggest.",CF_7wpDpCmp
124,Only parts of the teaching materials are made available for the reader,CF_7wpDpCmp
125,I would like to see the entire material and know under which license it could be reused.,CF_7wpDpCmp
126,"- I wonder if the title should reflect that the paper is centered on teaching people working in libraries (on the other hand this might stop people from reading it, so not really sure)",CF_7wpDpCmp

129,This paper describes the curriculum of an introductory ML course given to non-STEM students at a Spanish higher education school,dhmIJ9SwAuG
130,"This course is embedded in a double degree program where graduate courses are offered that mix law, business and engineering",dhmIJ9SwAuG
131,"The material conveyed is then presented in the paper and key points for the delivery are highlighted, e.g",dhmIJ9SwAuG
132,"what model to introduce first, which metrics to concentrate on, how to angle the motivation for machine learning and how to control expectations",dhmIJ9SwAuG
133,The later lessons of the course then introduce more advanced model architectures like MLPs and SVMs,dhmIJ9SwAuG
134,The final episode of the curriculum are kaggle like projects for the students to work on.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
135,"If I understood correctly, the course is subsequent to a basic introduction to R and python",dhmIJ9SwAuG
136,"For sure, this is already a great effort for the students to pick up",dhmIJ9SwAuG
137,"What I like about this curriculum, is the focus on a simple linear regression approach to introduce students",dhmIJ9SwAuG
138,"Tying the core concepts of machine learning to this, appears to me like a splendid idea as it removes the complex math of say SVMs, MLPs et al from the teaching",dhmIJ9SwAuG
139,"This way, learners can focus on understanding supervised learning",dhmIJ9SwAuG
140,"Further, I like the idea of discussing this regression problem on a data set the learners can relate to",dhmIJ9SwAuG
141,"In this case, it is to predict the weight given the height and gender",dhmIJ9SwAuG
142,This direct relation of the prediction to real world observations appears to be a strong bridge and the basis for content uptake,dhmIJ9SwAuG
143,"On a second thought, any discriminatory aspects of the trained model could directly be discussed based on this fiducial analysis",dhmIJ9SwAuG
144,"This shows, what a versatile vehicle this data set and prediction task can be",dhmIJ9SwAuG
145,These two aspects are the 2 main outstanding strengths of the article.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
146,"There are a couple of things, I'd like to stress which I hope can help the author(s) to improve the paper content (potentially for the presentation at the workshop on Sep 14):",dhmIJ9SwAuG
147,"line 30 (right column) ""First contact of these students with Business Analytics is a 30 hours introductory course during the third semester."": It might be a good idea to set up learner profiles to illustrate the background knowledge of the participating students and (even more importantly) the goals of the students",dhmIJ9SwAuG
148,"I know that in an academic context, knowing where students want to work after their graduation is very hard; however, the mental model of the teacher of where she/he sees the learners after the course are an important aspect to communicate",dhmIJ9SwAuG
149,"line 40 (right column) ""The syllabus of the course starts with fundamentals of programming and statistics with the R language"": the text misses out to define clear learning goals; while the argumentation for the curriculum design is convincing, it remains hard to judge if the content can meet the learning goals as the former are not provided anywhere",dhmIJ9SwAuG
150,"line 52 ""Lessons 4 to 7 ..."": the text references specific lessons by number, but misses an overview of the number of lessons to be given and their time line; this aspect confused me multiple times",dhmIJ9SwAuG
151,A simple time line would provide a good degree of guidance to the reader here.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
152,"- page 2, line 67: the quote by Burkov is lovely, I would have loved to learn in what context it is presented",dhmIJ9SwAuG
153,"- page 2, line 103 (left column) ""We have a set of vectors X ..."": this appears to be a bit inconsistent to me, figure 1 discusses $y = f(x_1, ..., x_n)$ but the text talks about $X$ (capital) as the entire set",dhmIJ9SwAuG
154,"It would be nice to have consistent variable naming, so that the text is aligned to the figures.",dhmIJ9SwAuG
155,"- page 2, line 79 (right): ""the evil over-fitting game"" sounds very biased to me",dhmIJ9SwAuG
156,The text does not explain if or how the notion of evil is explained to the students,dhmIJ9SwAuG
157,I personally would try to dismiss these opinionated terms in courses as much as possible,dhmIJ9SwAuG
158,"Here ""evil"" conveys a negative intent",dhmIJ9SwAuG
159,"The following paragraph ""The example may sound a bit absurd ..."" for me is unable to fix the confusion about the synthetic over-fitting example",dhmIJ9SwAuG
160,I see the danger here to loose learners at this point.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
161,"- page 3, line 111 (left) ""L’Oréal's Rule to choose the optimal slope (Because I'm worth it)"" I didn't get this metaphor at all.",dhmIJ9SwAuG

163,"that uncertainty is an inevitable fact for ML models"" I am not sure what attack refers to here",dhmIJ9SwAuG
164,"I think introducing students to adversarial attacks is a good idea, but the text leaves it unclear if that the intend",dhmIJ9SwAuG
165,"- page 3, line 119 (left): ""The confusion matrix is well understood with the boy who cried wolf example of Type-I error."" It's unclear to me what the 'boy who cried wolf example' is",dhmIJ9SwAuG
166,"- page 3, line 152 (left): ""The minus sign and $log_2 (p_i )$ are the most feared beasts."" it is unclear what this means",dhmIJ9SwAuG
167,"I urge the authors to use scientific language, please",dhmIJ9SwAuG
168,"- page 3, line 152 (left): ""The minus sign and $log_2 (p_i )$ are the most feared beasts."" if learners struggle with this, one may wonder if it makes sense to introduce so many tricky concepts as noted in this paragraph and what level of depth are they expected to reach",dhmIJ9SwAuG
169,"This would tie back to the learner profiles (if present) mentioned earlier, learner profiles would clearly show which level of understanding is appropriate.",dhmIJ9SwAuG
170,"Overall, it would be wonderful to see an objective quality assessment of this curriculum in the future",dhmIJ9SwAuG
171,"Given clear learning goals and learner profiles, such a quantitative analysis of e.g",dhmIJ9SwAuG
172,post-course surveys could also help to assess if learning goals have been met.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
173,Thanks to the authors for submitting their paper,dhmIJ9SwAuG
174,I enjoyed reading it and learning how the structured their course.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
175,The submission describes an introductory course on Machine Learning targeted at,dhmIJ9SwAuG
176,"students outside of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics",dhmIJ9SwAuG
177,(STEM) fields such as Law or Marketing.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
178,The submission has great value and can therefore be recommended for acceptance.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
179,"In particular, it includes reports on student feedback to different parts of",dhmIJ9SwAuG
180,"the taught course, which will be valuable information for other workshop",dhmIJ9SwAuG
181,"Additionally, the described course material teaches important",dhmIJ9SwAuG
182,concepts such as interpretation of black-box models and overfitting using,dhmIJ9SwAuG
183,"It also includes hands-on coding parts, which is an effective",dhmIJ9SwAuG
184,"Apart from minor typographical mistakes which will not be covered here, some",dhmIJ9SwAuG

196,"Other that that, the presented course and especially the author's experience",dhmIJ9SwAuG
197,will be beneficial for the present workshop.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
198,The paper presents an experience report of teaching an introductory class on machine learning to business and law students that do not necessarily have a strong background in mathematics and/or programming,dhmIJ9SwAuG
199,"On a high level, the paper describes the curriculum, diving deeper into only some aspects",dhmIJ9SwAuG
200,"The pathway starts with linear regression and progresses up to logistic regression on the Iris data set, neural networks, and SVMs",dhmIJ9SwAuG
201,"Finally, the students are exposed to a practical challenge that they solve using graphical environments provided by Azure ML.",dhmIJ9SwAuG
202,I find the proposed curriculum not particularly surprising (lin,dhmIJ9SwAuG
203,"reg -> neural networks), I was a bit surprised to see SVMs as one of the models the students were exposed to - given that they are mathematically more involved than, e.g., simple neural networks, in my opinion",dhmIJ9SwAuG
204,Other than that I really liked some of the anecdotal cues such as giving a grade bonus based on performance on the final project or using a graphical environment for modeling,dhmIJ9SwAuG
205,"Or, the ""evil overfitting game"" -> definitely something to try",dhmIJ9SwAuG
206,I would have appreciated a little more insight into what the students liked/disliked or more tangible material in the form of code and data,dhmIJ9SwAuG
207,Nevertheless I think the authors should participate in the workshop.,dhmIJ9SwAuG
208,"- Page 2, line 63: Just up for debate: While I understand the intention behind disillusioning students that were exposed to hype-fueled media reports, I am note sure if harshly stating something along the lines of ""machines don't learn"" or ""ML is just glorified curve fitting"" is strategically useful early on in a class",dhmIJ9SwAuG
209,"After all, what constitutes learning it is still a matter of definition",dhmIJ9SwAuG
210,A little mystery and fascination (think of chatting with GPT-3 or using Google draw) can be helpful as long as the mathematical and algorithmic underpinning is not neglected,dhmIJ9SwAuG
211,"But again, this is just my opinion and another point of view and no criticism of the submission.",dhmIJ9SwAuG
212,"- Page 2, line 98: ""predict the weight of an undergraduate student just knowing its height and gender."" --> ""predict the weight of undergraduate students just knowing their height and gender."" or ""predict the weight of an undergraduate student just knowing his/her height and gender.""",dhmIJ9SwAuG
213,"- Page 3, line 153: I have made the same experience and found that the minus sign and log become less scary when referring to the information content",dhmIJ9SwAuG
214,An event with a probability of 1/4 is as probable as picking one of (1/4)^(-1) = 4 balls at random and we'd need log(4) bits to distinguish all of these balls,dhmIJ9SwAuG
215,Taking the expected value gives us entropy.,dhmIJ9SwAuG

219,"From personal experience with teaching Machine Learning, I can confirm that the knowledge about the mathematical background and the structure of the algorithms alone is not sufficient to apply these methods to specific problems as there are further technical challenges to solve",oeM-Rb7nqoh
220,- The focus on practical aspects of applying machine learning,oeM-Rb7nqoh
221,"- The repeated contact with concepts, in different stages of the learning process (cyclic framework)",oeM-Rb7nqoh
222,- The idea that communicating technical concepts is an essential skill,oeM-Rb7nqoh
223,- The usage of version control and testing is part of the course,oeM-Rb7nqoh
224,- Bonus points for incorporating the ethical implications of ML algorithms,oeM-Rb7nqoh
225,- Is the focus on implementing the algorithms or applying them? For example: Implementing a k-means clustering correctly might be a different challenge than applying it to a particular problem,oeM-Rb7nqoh
226,I am unsure whats the focus of the course,oeM-Rb7nqoh
227,"- Some information about the content of the ""model evaluation"" part of the course would be great",oeM-Rb7nqoh
228,"- This paper gives a general overview of the topic (due to length regulations), some more details about the topics and tasks would help",oeM-Rb7nqoh
229,It would be great if the course material would be publicly available,oeM-Rb7nqoh
230,- I am unsure why Table 1,oeM-Rb7nqoh
231,"lists ""Linear Regression"" as ""Train/Test Paradigm""",oeM-Rb7nqoh
232,"Would expect something like ""n-fold cross-validation"".",oeM-Rb7nqoh
233,The paper highlights a course on computational ML offered in a CS program,oeM-Rb7nqoh
234,"The course is intended as an accessible entry point to ML for undergraduate students, and assumes programming background and some mathematical maturity (either LA or multi-variable calculus are required)",oeM-Rb7nqoh
235,"In addition to introducing ML and its links with CS, the course also poses the interesting question on what habits of mind are needed for ML practitioners",oeM-Rb7nqoh
236,"This is, in my experience, a necessary skill for ML practitioners where most practical problems come with unique caveats",oeM-Rb7nqoh
237,"The learning outcomes for the course likewise cover a fairly broad spectrum of topics, ranging from implementing to understanding different ML algorithms",oeM-Rb7nqoh
238,"The course also addresses ethical concerns and collaborative development, which is exciting to see at such an early stage",oeM-Rb7nqoh
239,Use of continuous integration and unit testing is also a welcome addition to the course,oeM-Rb7nqoh
240,"The cyclic framework should be an excellent tool for reinforcing learning outcomes, I really liked the concept!",oeM-Rb7nqoh
241,The authors decided to start the course with unsupervised learning algorithms rather than supervised learning,oeM-Rb7nqoh
242,"While I do not have an issue with this reordering naturally, I was wondering if the authors uncovered any evidence that one way or the other was more effective",oeM-Rb7nqoh
243,This would be very useful for the broader community.,oeM-Rb7nqoh
244,"While the course covers continuous integration, is this limited to the code the students write or does it extend also to the models they train? Do students deal with concepts such as how to serialise, share and/or update their models in an online setting?",oeM-Rb7nqoh
245,I would be very interested in reading some of the feedback the authors received (so tying back to point 1),oeM-Rb7nqoh
246,"Also, the author's experience of using Github Classroom and Travis CI in this setting would be very interesting",oeM-Rb7nqoh
247,"If lack of space is an issue, perhaps the authors could include this information in their presentation?",oeM-Rb7nqoh
248,The paper describes a course for computer science students,oeM-Rb7nqoh
249,The course teaches concepts of machine learning with a focus on implementation of methods,oeM-Rb7nqoh
250,On the side it teaches important skill like version control and clitical thinking.,oeM-Rb7nqoh
251,The paper nicely describes this introductory machine learning course,oeM-Rb7nqoh
252,"The focus on implementation is unusual, yet interesting",oeM-Rb7nqoh
253,"The cyclic framework described in the paper, as well as the active classroom, the flexibility system in assignments and the use of computational notebooks and continuous integration, are exciting to see.",oeM-Rb7nqoh
254,I would have hoped for a link to the teaching material or at least an example showing one of the notebooks.,oeM-Rb7nqoh
255,"Also I remain with one question: Are the teaching materials openly available? If not, why?",oeM-Rb7nqoh
256,"If space in the paper was the issue, I would rather neglect the description of the two courses (stats and CS) and the college/students ",oeM-Rb7nqoh
257,"Also, it would have been nice to read, what the students think about the coures (e.g",oeM-Rb7nqoh
258,- Learning objectives: the first point seems like two points to me,oeM-Rb7nqoh
259,- Learning objectives: assess efficacy is mentioned in both points 2 and 3 and thus could be deleted in point 2,oeM-Rb7nqoh
260,"- Evaluation: ""mix a severeal machine learning ideas"" -> ""mix severeal machine learning ideas""",oeM-Rb7nqoh
261,"- Evaluation: what do you mean by ""slack site""?",oeM-Rb7nqoh
262,XploreML is an interactive tool that allows for students to explore various classification algorithms dynamically,7lv81_zr4TZ
263,The paper's current presentation of XploreML leaves it to the reader to determine the learning goals of this tool,7lv81_zr4TZ
264,"Additionally, while the authors discuss using backward design in their implementation for using this tool, without the learning goals specified, it is challenging to understand where and how this tool comes into a machine learning course",7lv81_zr4TZ
265,"Is it the first, second, last, etc contact for a student learning a concept? Finally, one of the features that I was most interested in was the code extraction",7lv81_zr4TZ
266,I felt that this was shortchanged in the current draft.  ,7lv81_zr4TZ
267,"The user study presented in this paper does make an effort to address this second issue, by having two different groups of students interact with XploreML either in a lecture or lab setting",7lv81_zr4TZ
268,"However, there is no control group that never works with this tool",7lv81_zr4TZ
269,"Additionally, the survey questions from the user study are about how much one likes the tool (which certainly has its place), instead of an evaluation tool that attempts to determine if working with XploreML leads to deeper understanding of classification. ",7lv81_zr4TZ
270,* Interesting and accessible tool (via `shiny`) ,7lv81_zr4TZ
271,* Demonstrates that XploreML can be used in lecture or lab settings,7lv81_zr4TZ
272,* Does not explicitly connect XploreML to learning outcomes,7lv81_zr4TZ
273,* Difficult to determine the impact of this tool on learning,7lv81_zr4TZ
274,* It would be great if the abstract discussed the level of the students that this tool is intended for ,7lv81_zr4TZ
275,"* Typo in left side of line 041 ""aswell' --> ""as well"" ",7lv81_zr4TZ
276,"* Right side of lines 051 and 052, the authors might consider using a different typeface for the various packages (such as \texttt{})",7lv81_zr4TZ
277,XploreML presents an interactive GUI for learning fundamentals of supervised classification models,7lv81_zr4TZ
278,"This app has potential to be used as a training tool, however, implementation lacks clarity and stability.",7lv81_zr4TZ
279,- One major issue is that sever gets disconnected quite often and it is set to default settings when reloaded again,7lv81_zr4TZ
280,This means that while mentors/students are discussing aspects of current implementation the results will be gone and everything needs to be set again from scratch,7lv81_zr4TZ
281,- The app offers selection of only a few hyperparameters,7lv81_zr4TZ
282,"Learning rate in the neural net, depth in random forest are important adjustable hyperparameters",7lv81_zr4TZ
283,"Also, the number of CV folds and bootstraps and train, validation and test split should be adjustable",7lv81_zr4TZ
284,- The raw data tab in visualization pane does not show class labels,7lv81_zr4TZ
285,Complete visualization of raw data with class labels is a very fundamental aspect of beginning ML teaching/learning process,7lv81_zr4TZ
286,"- Furthermore, in the visualization of data the ‘parallel coordinates’ does not help understand data for beginners rather it looks confusing",7lv81_zr4TZ
287,"For beginners, clear plots should be used such that students can easily read and understand data stats themselves without a mentor’s intervention",7lv81_zr4TZ
288,Plots of data with more than 4 features are almost unreadable.,7lv81_zr4TZ
289,"- While running a new model, the results and stats from the previous run remain intact, which is very confusing.",7lv81_zr4TZ
290,- A very basic model taught in supervised binary classification is the logistic regression model which is missing in this app,7lv81_zr4TZ
291,"Although LDA is closely related to logistic regression, but for beginners, it will make more sense to make them familiar with logistic regression for classification than LDA.",7lv81_zr4TZ
292,"The authors propose an interactive GUI for exploring basic supervised classification models, however, it is not very handy in its current state",7lv81_zr4TZ
293,"It offers only a few adjustable parameters, inconsistent view, and unstable server",7lv81_zr4TZ
294, All these factors make it unlikely to be accepted,7lv81_zr4TZ
295,This *could* be a great resource for experimentation in supervised learning without any programming,7lv81_zr4TZ
296,The app is well-documented and covers most classifiers that a standard intro to supervised ML would contain.,7lv81_zr4TZ
297,"For courses that are based on the software stack used here (R + caret), the fact that the code generating the models can be inspected, too, is even more valuable.",7lv81_zr4TZ
298,"Unfortunately, the implementation seems to be very unstable, buggy and slow:",7lv81_zr4TZ
299,"- xgboost did not work on any of the datasets I tried, it would hang for a couple of minutes and then spit out a generic error message",7lv81_zr4TZ
300,"- results from previous runs were not updated, so one tab would show classification boundaries for a decision tree, say, while the other tab would still show confusion matrices for a LDA model computed earlier",7lv81_zr4TZ
301,"Didactically, that's terrible, because students will not have the self-confidence and experience to recognize the wrong/incongruopus results presented by the app",7lv81_zr4TZ
302,"At the very least, the interface should be programmed so that results that are ""out of date"" are greyed out until they are recomputed for the current model.",7lv81_zr4TZ
303,"- the server hosting it was very unresponsive for most of the time I tried to experiment with it, loading the app and reccomputing even very simple models like LDA took a (very) long time on all three occasions that I used it",7lv81_zr4TZ
304,- there seems to be no way to abort computations once they are under way and users lose patience,7lv81_zr4TZ
305,This is not a good UX.,7lv81_zr4TZ
306,"In terms of functionality, I would have liked to see the possibilty of tuning/changing more than 1 hyperparameter for some of the methods, sometimes the interplay of them is very important (e.g",7lv81_zr4TZ
307,"max tree depth and min node size), and having only one of the many hyperparameters configurable is likely to lead to misunderstandings like ""this is the only tuning parameter that matters"" on the side of the students",7lv81_zr4TZ
308,"Paper needs a spell check (""aswell"", ""interactivelly"" etc) and should be proof-read by a dilligent native speaker (""in specific classification"" -> ""specifically classification"", lots of other weird phrases).",7lv81_zr4TZ
309,Code for the Shiny app should be made public to enable local hosting instead of relying on RStudio's rather limited free hosting.,7lv81_zr4TZ
310,"This is a fairly ambitious project with large potential, not all that well executed",7lv81_zr4TZ
311,"I don't think I would use it in my teaching in its current state, too many frustrating bugs and inconsistencies and too much waiting around on the unresponsive server (although the shiny app could be easily hosted locally if the authors make their code public, see below, and this would presumably speed up computation and rendering quite a bit) ",7lv81_zr4TZ
312,I appreciate the efforts by the authors to submit an article to ECML2020's teaching ML workshop,WT9PkhFT_dO
313,The submitted document does not comply with the layouting requirements our workshop has,WT9PkhFT_dO
314,"Further, the article exceeds the page limit by more than a factor of 2",WT9PkhFT_dO
315,Both of these aspects make it unlikely to be accepted,WT9PkhFT_dO
316,A majority of the text is written in colloquial language which to me does not aspire to the neutral character an article needs to be written in,WT9PkhFT_dO
317,"Further, the author gives away his name which makes a double blind review process impossible.",WT9PkhFT_dO
318,"- page 4: yields a general praise of today's Machine Learning (ML) given it's applications which is fine, but in the wrong place to illustrate a teaching approach for ML",WT9PkhFT_dO
319,"- page 5: contains appealing metaphors to compare the inner workings of a Machine Learning algorithm, but fails to connect these insights to teaching approach that is to be presented",WT9PkhFT_dO
320,- page 6: contains again a praise of Machine Learning in general; point 5 tries to motivate the teaching demo by aspiring to prepare programmers for the use of tensorflow or other tools (which are vaguely touched),WT9PkhFT_dO
321,- page 6: the bottom of the page lists a point one after point 6 which is most likely a typo,WT9PkhFT_dO
322,- page 7: describes the live coding demo in a mixture of bullet points and prose text; here the author describes how a predictor of an XOR operation is live coded during the demo,WT9PkhFT_dO
323,"In itself, this is a wonderful idea as it is simple enough to construct a hard coded network around this",WT9PkhFT_dO
324,"Unfortunately, the way the paper is written hinders a clear understanding on how the demo is provided and what the author wants to achieve his listeners ",WT9PkhFT_dO
325,"To improve the paper, I suggest the following improvements:",WT9PkhFT_dO
326,- follow the layout requirements of our workshop,WT9PkhFT_dO
327,- keep the volume within 4 pages (without references),WT9PkhFT_dO
328,- present the learning goals of the live demo,WT9PkhFT_dO
329,- present 2-3 learner profiles of the people you expect to participate in the live demo,WT9PkhFT_dO
330,- describe key aspects of the code to be demonstrated,WT9PkhFT_dO
331,"- show how the presented code ties back to the motivation, the learner profiles and learning goals",WT9PkhFT_dO
332,- present evaluation data of how your learners liked the demo and on what they learned,WT9PkhFT_dO
333,"Given the outstanding ideas hidden in the submission, I feel very sorry to reject this paper.",WT9PkhFT_dO
334,The submission consists of an announcement concerning a live coding tutorial,WT9PkhFT_dO
335,given in 2019 at the 15th International Conference On Intelligent Tutoring,WT9PkhFT_dO
336,It shows the author's enthusiasm for the covered,WT9PkhFT_dO
337,topic and for teaching the latter.,WT9PkhFT_dO
338,"However, the submission fails to comply with this workshop's submission format,",WT9PkhFT_dO
339,which is the ICML 2019 LaTeX template,WT9PkhFT_dO
340,Therefore I cannot recommend this submission to be,WT9PkhFT_dO
341,"accepted, which is unfortunate, given the author's clearly high motivation.",WT9PkhFT_dO
342,"Nevertheless, I strongly suggest to submit a revised version to a later",WT9PkhFT_dO
343,iteration of this or another workshop with a similar scope,WT9PkhFT_dO
344,"future submissions more successful, I'd like to point out some aspects that may",WT9PkhFT_dO
345,Even though this workshop's call for papers states that submissions shall,WT9PkhFT_dO
346,"""present *or* discuss a teaching activity related to machine learning"", a",WT9PkhFT_dO
347,discussion of the experiences from teaching at the ITS2019 workshop would have,WT9PkhFT_dO
348,greatly increased the value of this submission,WT9PkhFT_dO
349,"is, as it seems, an unaltered copy of a workshop announcement for ITS2019,",WT9PkhFT_dO
350,rather than an article targeted to the present workshop,WT9PkhFT_dO
351,"future submission might benefit from (i) usage of the common abbreviation ""AI""",WT9PkhFT_dO
352,"(uppercase) rather than ""Ai"", (ii) writing out other acronyms such as ITS or",WT9PkhFT_dO
353,"UWI that might not be known by all readers, (iii) reduced usage of everyday",WT9PkhFT_dO
354,"language (optional, depending on personal style as well as the submission's",WT9PkhFT_dO
355,"The submission's content has potential and can be a valuable contribution,",WT9PkhFT_dO
356,which I hope to see in future workshops.,WT9PkhFT_dO
357,The submission presents an announcement that was used to advertise a workshop on programming artificial neural networks at ITS 2019 in Jamaica,WT9PkhFT_dO
358,The tutorial's goal was to show how to program a simple neural network that is able to decide the XOR function in a 45 minutes live coding session,WT9PkhFT_dO
359,The tutorial also offered some source code accompanying the material: https://github.com/JordanMicahBennett/BASIC-ARTIFICIAL-NEURAL-NETWORK_FROM-LIVE-JAVA-SESSION,WT9PkhFT_dO
360,While I do think that the tutorial is valuable (esp,WT9PkhFT_dO
361,"for the Jamaican programming/growing AI community), I think the submission is not suited well for this particular workshop: 1",WT9PkhFT_dO
362,"it does not adhere to the formatting guidelines stating the ICML template, 2",WT9PkhFT_dO
363,I there recommend to reject this submission.,WT9PkhFT_dO
364,It would have been a great opportunity to share some of the lessons learned from the tutorial held in 2019,WT9PkhFT_dO
365,I very much encourage the author to resubmit such an experience report to the next edition of the workshop,WT9PkhFT_dO
366,"Still, attending the workshop and contributing to a shared position paper could be envisioned.",WT9PkhFT_dO
