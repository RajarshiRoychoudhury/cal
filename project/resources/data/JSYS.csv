0,"The paper presents TriScale, a methodology for analyzing the replicability of experiments",c1LNi8CTPy6
1,"The paper achieves this by partitioning the data into multiple timescales---runs, series, and sequels---and analyzing temporal characteristics of variability at these timescales",c1LNi8CTPy6
2,"TriScale relies on “variability score,” an estimate of how similar the results are during a replication effort, to quantify the replicability",c1LNi8CTPy6
3,Four case studies of various network applications using TriScale is also presented.,c1LNi8CTPy6
4,+ TriScale tackles an important problem related to replicability of experiments in research,c1LNi8CTPy6
5,+ The systematic methodology presented in TriScale can improve the community’s confidence about research results presented in a paper and its replication efforts,c1LNi8CTPy6
6,+ The paper is well-written and easy-to-follow  ,c1LNi8CTPy6
7,- A more detailed discussion on metrics/settings that cannot be evaluated using TriScale will be helpful ,c1LNi8CTPy6
8,Thanks for submitting your paper to JSYS 2021.,c1LNi8CTPy6
9,TriScale takes an important step towards improving reproducibility efforts in the community,c1LNi8CTPy6
10,"It can help researchers determine the number of runs, duration of runs, etc",c1LNi8CTPy6
11,required to ascertain the confidence in conclusions derived from an experiment,c1LNi8CTPy6
12,The paper is well-written and easy to follow.,c1LNi8CTPy6
13,There are a few aspects that can be improved in the paper,c1LNi8CTPy6
14,* It is understandable that TriScale cannot determine the parameters that should be used for experiments,c1LNi8CTPy6
15,"However, it will be useful to identify the categories of metrics that cannot be used with TriScale",c1LNi8CTPy6
16,"For example, the paper mentions that the convergence test does not hold while measuring energy consumption since it is cumulative over time, and hence, one should measure power draw instead",c1LNi8CTPy6
17,Cumulative metrics cannot be tested for convergence,c1LNi8CTPy6
18,"Are there other categories of metrics that do not fit under TriScale framework? It will be useful to identify them explicitly (also, highlight in the discussion section that cumulative metrics cannot be measured)",c1LNi8CTPy6
19,"* Can TriScale be used with metrics that need a distributed view? For example, maximum queue length encountered by a packet on its path within a data center.",c1LNi8CTPy6
20,"* TriScale employs specific techniques for each step (Theil-Sen linear regression for convergence test, Thompson’s method for confidence interval estimations, etc.)",c1LNi8CTPy6
21,"Are there alternatives? If so, is it easy to plug in another user-preferred function in place of the TriScale default functions?",c1LNi8CTPy6
22,* Network profiling for identifying seasonal components is interesting,c1LNi8CTPy6
23,But what if the seasonal components in the replication environment do not match with the seasonal components in the original environment,c1LNi8CTPy6
24,"For example, the original experiment is cellular analysis performed in a business district and the replication effort is in a residential area",c1LNi8CTPy6
25,Can network profiling be used to raise an alarm that the replication environment does not match the original environment and that is the cause for a bad variability score? ,c1LNi8CTPy6
26,"* A category of experiments in networking involves testing convergence of protocols when users arrive/leave, links fail, etc",c1LNi8CTPy6
27,The time taken by congestion control (for example) to converge under these conditions is an important performance criterion,c1LNi8CTPy6
28,How will TriScale handle such metrics? ,c1LNi8CTPy6
29,"Overall, TriScale is a useful effort that can improve reproducibility efforts in the community",c1LNi8CTPy6
30,"However, it will be useful to clearly describe the shortcomings of the system, particularly metrics that cannot be handled",c1LNi8CTPy6
31,Thank you for submitting your work to JSys,c1LNi8CTPy6
32,The paper tackles an important and often overlooked problem of replicability in networking research,c1LNi8CTPy6
33,"The effort is commendable, thorough, and can be used by other researchers as a template to effectively design experiments and report their results.",c1LNi8CTPy6
34,+ Significance: the paper addresses an important problem,c1LNi8CTPy6
35,+ Clarity: the proposed methodology is intuitive and easy to follow,c1LNi8CTPy6
36,+ Generalizability: It is unclear where exactly the proposed methodology will fail and why? Section 6 is not really helpful in understanding these limitations,c1LNi8CTPy6
37,"This paper addresses a critical problem in networking research, replicability",c1LNi8CTPy6
38,We all know many research artifacts published at top-tier conferences are hard to replicate,c1LNi8CTPy6
39,Designing experiments that report the performance of the proposed research artifacts with quantifiable confidence amidst inherent variability is non-trivial,c1LNi8CTPy6
40,Researchers often opt for simpler rules-of-thumb that were applied by previous works,c1LNi8CTPy6
41,"These rules don't generalize, and applying them leads to hard-to-replicate experiments/results",c1LNi8CTPy6
42,"More specifically, the lack of concrete methodology to determine the run/series duration and the number of sequences make it difficult to quantify the true performance of the proposed research artifacts",c1LNi8CTPy6
43,"The methodology proposed in this paper will aid the researchers in evaluating existing and future research artifacts, promoting replicability",c1LNi8CTPy6
44,"In Section 6, it will help if the paper can expand on instances where the proposed methodology is not suited to evaluate the replicability of the proposed solution",c1LNi8CTPy6
45,I struggled to grasp the generality of the proposed methodology,c1LNi8CTPy6
46,Though I am glad to see the paper applying the proposed methodology to five different problems,c1LNi8CTPy6
47,It will be great to elaborate on what attributes of these problems enable applying the proposed methodology,c1LNi8CTPy6
48,"Further, elaborate, with examples, on which type of problems (artifacts) will not benefit from Triscale. ",c1LNi8CTPy6
49,This paper proposes a methodology for the experiment design and data analysis of performance evaluations,c1LNi8CTPy6
50,"In addition to test runs and series of runs that have been widely adopted, the authors introduce another time scale -- repetitions of series -- to capture the replicability of an experiment, via the definition of a quantifiable score (""variability score"") with user-specified confidence level.",c1LNi8CTPy6
51,"Furthermore, the paper instantiates the methodology as a software framework called TriScale and showcases the framework's usefulness with case studies.",c1LNi8CTPy6
52,- First-of-its-kind paper to quantify the replicability of performance evaluations,c1LNi8CTPy6
53,- Developed a readily usable framework to implement the concrete methodology,c1LNi8CTPy6
54,- TriScale's methodology has its own practicality issues (explained in the comments),c1LNi8CTPy6
55,Thank you for submitting your work to JSys,c1LNi8CTPy6
56,I really enjoyed reading the paper,c1LNi8CTPy6
57,Its excellent writing clearly outlines the methodology as well as the statistical methods,c1LNi8CTPy6
58,I also appreciate the development effort of the tool TriScale.,c1LNi8CTPy6
59,"TriScale is most useful in guiding networking researchers to design scientifically sound experiments, such as how long each run should be based on the convergence test, how many runs / series of runs to perform before meeting a specific confidence level, and the time span of a series of runs hinted by the network profiling",c1LNi8CTPy6
60,"Therefore, TriScale could potentially help avoid design mistakes and also significantly foster reproducible studies.",c1LNi8CTPy6
61,"1a is indeed prone to misinterpretation, as the paper also incorrectly interprets one-sigma ellipses as ""one can expect about 68% of the data points to fall in that region""",c1LNi8CTPy6
62,"The correct percentage is supposed to be 40% because each ellipse represents the confidence region of the sum of squares of two Gaussian-distributed variables, which follows a chi-squared distribution",c1LNi8CTPy6
63,"The projections of such an ellipse on either dimension are indeed 68% confidence intervals, but the two-dimensional confidence region is about 40%.",c1LNi8CTPy6
64,"- The KPI of common interest is often multi-dimensional, e.g., people want to know both the lower and upper bounds of a performance metric, or both the average performance and performance variation (robustness)",c1LNi8CTPy6
65,It is unclear how useful the one-dimensional KPI of TriScale would be in practice,c1LNi8CTPy6
66,"If TriScale extends the current KPI, e.g., if Fig",c1LNi8CTPy6
67,"1(b) reports two-sided CIs instead, then it will have the same issue as Fig",c1LNi8CTPy6
68,"1(a) when two schemes' CIs are overlapping, losing the claimed advantage ""unambiguously compare different schemes""",c1LNi8CTPy6
69,The issue is not easily fixable also because the variability score cannot seem to accommodate multi-dimensional KPIs,c1LNi8CTPy6
70,What would the score be if the KPI is a two-sided CI? This seems different from a multi-objective evaluation and has not been discussed in the paper.,c1LNi8CTPy6
71,"- In the same vein, TriScale does not capture the correlation of metrics",c1LNi8CTPy6
72,"1 as an example again: The one-sigma ellipses in (a) suggest the correlation between throughput and latency (which are usually positively correlated), but the information is lost in (b)",c1LNi8CTPy6
73,"Again, Pareto-dominance does not address the correlation of metrics.",c1LNi8CTPy6
74,"- TriScale can check whether a runtime passes the convergence test, but it does not really give a practical way for researchers to choose the runtime during the experiment design",c1LNi8CTPy6
75,"For instance, the ramp-up time of LEDBAT's throughput would also depend on the bandwidth -- Does it mean that for each network profile, researchers have to increase the runtime repeatedly until the convergence test is passed?",c1LNi8CTPy6
76,"- Despite TriScale's usefulness, the definition of ""variability score"" essentially repeats what researchers have been applying to a series of runs, treating each experiment as a run",c1LNi8CTPy6
77,The quantifiable replicability is not novel in this sense (maybe it does not need to be novel?).,c1LNi8CTPy6
78,* Generally well-written and relatively easy to follow,c1LNi8CTPy6
79,"* Useful, could potentially benefit all scientific researchers",c1LNi8CTPy6
80,* Methodology is grounded from strong theoretical analysis,c1LNi8CTPy6
81,* Methodology is a bit high-level and lacks more detailed solutions,c1LNi8CTPy6
82,* More like a general experimental design tool instead of in the networking domain,c1LNi8CTPy6
83,Thank you for submitting TriScale to JSys,c1LNi8CTPy6
84,I enjoyed reading your paper learning how ,c1LNi8CTPy6
85,foundational insights in statistics can be applied to networking experiment design,c1LNi8CTPy6
86,"While networking researchers have been working hard to come up with new solutions and conduct extensive evaluations, it’s also the time for us to have a better understanding and more careful examination of experimental results, and that’s where TriScale could potentially help",c1LNi8CTPy6
87,"Meanwhile, I have a few comments below, which I hope could further improve the paper.",c1LNi8CTPy6
88,* It’s nice to break down experiment design into three questions and answer each one by one,c1LNi8CTPy6
89,"However, I feel that the provided solution is a bit limited in what it can help",c1LNi8CTPy6
90,"For example, given that convergence test does not always apply, oftentimes it’s still hard to know how long a run should be, e.g., for video streaming experiments what should be the total streaming duration in order to compare QoE for different streaming systems/algorithms? The paper uses long-term throughput as an example for congestion control evaluation, but sometimes we need to consider the impact of start-up time, say for short-lived flows/web pages",c1LNi8CTPy6
91,"More importantly, a user testing a system oftentimes doesn't know whether she really needs the convergence test, and in this case it would be more helpful if the tool (TriScale) can give some hints",c1LNi8CTPy6
92,"The authors mention that “Given the user’s objectives (e.g., the KPIs to analyze and the confidence levels to reach), TriScale helps answer questions...”, but it's still not very clear how to define the KPIs and choose the confidence level, e.g., should I choose mean, median, or some percentile? The paper also says “for each performance dimension, the user defines a metric together with its convergence requirements, a KPI, and a variability score”, but sometimes a user may not know how to best define them",c1LNi8CTPy6
93,"It would be better if TriScale can give some suggestions on these low-level details, say according to how much computation resources/time a user has (e.g., lower down the confidence level or analyze only the median if one needs to get some quick results) or what the high-level goals of the experiments are.",c1LNi8CTPy6
94,* The methodology has high generality with little assumption of the underlying distribution,c1LNi8CTPy6
95,"While this makes TriScale more widely applicable and easy to use in some cases, I still wonder if there could be cases where the distribution follows a specific model and TriScale could be tuned to gain improved analysis, especially when those cases are common in networking and the gain is worthwhile, e.g., more accurate claims with fewer runs",c1LNi8CTPy6
96,"Also, if it’s emulation/simulation/testbed, how would the methodology be adjusted accordingly? Would domain-specific optimizations be beneficial, say web, video, congestion control, routing, wireless, etc? There may also be application specific requirements, e.g., in determining how long a run should be",c1LNi8CTPy6
97,"* Saying “Tools like Pantheon [84] support data collection, but leave the design of the experiments and the data analysis up to the researcher” makes the scope of “design of the experiments” seem limited to the three questions TriScale answers",c1LNi8CTPy6
98,"However, it’s much more than that, e.g., including what network conditions and workloads to use",c1LNi8CTPy6
99,To me the paper is mostly on “when” (durations and specific start times) to run experiments instead of the entire “experiment design” which is a much bigger scope/problem to solve.,c1LNi8CTPy6
100,"* In the congestion control motivating example, the authors mention that Copa data is not i.i.d., what’s the reason for that? And this seems to disobey “A common hypothesis is that the collected data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.).” ",c1LNi8CTPy6
101,* Fig 1: The authors argue that “Contrary to what Fig,c1LNi8CTPy6
102,"1a suggests, we observe in Fig",c1LNi8CTPy6
103,"1b that TCP Vegas is not strictly better than TaoVA-100x”, however, Fig",c1LNi8CTPy6
104,"1a only shows that the mean throughput of Vegas is better than Tao’s, while Fig",c1LNi8CTPy6
105,"1b draws 25th throughput, so it’s more of a different metric than contrary",c1LNi8CTPy6
106,"Also, it would be better to color the label of different schemes as well: some dots are too close to each other so it’s hard to tell which label/text corresponds to which dot.",c1LNi8CTPy6
107,* Need more details on how different works such as [84] handles uncontrollable environments,c1LNi8CTPy6
108,Some related ideas/tools for more controllable experiments are missing in the paper: Epload (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/nsdi14/nsdi14-paper-wang_xiao_sophia.pdf) allows to control the variability of computation while also modeling page load dependencies for web browsing,c1LNi8CTPy6
109,Livelyzer (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3458305.3463375) leverages virtual video capture to enable repeatable live video broadcast,c1LNi8CTPy6
110,Another study (https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/dkoutsonikolas/publications/pam21.pdf) uses a programmable 3-axis motion controller to collect traces in a controlled environment efficiently and in an automated way.,c1LNi8CTPy6
111,"* “One should also consider robust statistics (e.g., using median instead of mean), i.e., statistics that are not overly skewed by outliers, which are common in experimental networking data.” would be good to have some examples on this.",c1LNi8CTPy6
112,"* “Only users can know what is more appropriate for their evaluation, but it is important to understand this distinction when designing it.” again, the user may not always know, or at least prefer some tool that tells her such.",c1LNi8CTPy6

116,"""SoK: A Generalized Multi-Leader State Machine Replication Tutorial"" presents a pedagogical consensus protocol called PPaxos and several improvements on it",4Xo8nv5DNS
117,The main idea is that we can understand complex high-performance consensus protocols better by separating dependency service from the main Paxos protocol,4Xo8nv5DNS
118,"It starts with Paxos and MultiPaxos, and then introduces the idea of conflict and dependency graph",4Xo8nv5DNS
119,"By separating the dependency requirement, it presents two interesting concepts tension avoidance and tension resolution.",4Xo8nv5DNS
120,"- Walking through the development of PPaxos, readers can build an in-depth understanding of dependency graph-based consensus protocols",4Xo8nv5DNS
121,"- Although the paper targets to be a pedagogical paper, it is not easy to read",4Xo8nv5DNS
122,Cleaning up writing may be necessary.,4Xo8nv5DNS
123,- Paper often gets not precise,4Xo8nv5DNS
124,Clear assumptions and thorough correctness arguments are missing,4Xo8nv5DNS
125,I think this paper has the potential to be a good tutorial to dependency graph-based consensus protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
126,"I think this paper is specifically on dependency graph-based Paxos protocols, not for general multi-leader consensus protocols.) However, it wasn't a paper that reads smoothly, especially since this paper presents many different protocols",4Xo8nv5DNS
127,"As it is targetting to be a pedagogical paper, I recommend authors to spend time on that",4Xo8nv5DNS
128,"In the detailed comments below, I added a few suggestions.",4Xo8nv5DNS
129,"Also, the paper gets loose on preciseness from time to time",4Xo8nv5DNS
130,I understand that it might be impossible to present proofs to all protocols presented,4Xo8nv5DNS
131,But it sometimes felt too loose to wrap my mind about correctness,4Xo8nv5DNS
132,"Finally, I felt the paper wanders among various PPaxos & other prior work",4Xo8nv5DNS
133,I wonder if setting up a goal upfront would be helpful,4Xo8nv5DNS
134,It might be useful to set the goal of understanding EPaxos like protocols and why people want them,4Xo8nv5DNS

153,There is no introduction of the meaning of direction,4Xo8nv5DNS
154,The definition of dependency explained so far doesn't pose any order.,4Xo8nv5DNS
155,"- 3.2, ""Replicas execute conflict graphs in reverse topological order"" => why? what goes wrong if executed in topological order? I could imagine it's like EPaxos, but unclear",4Xo8nv5DNS

171,- I don't understand how EPaxos leverages FastPaxos,4Xo8nv5DNS
172,"Also, EPaxos's key advantage is optimistic two wide-area message delays",4Xo8nv5DNS
173,"More explanation is needed here on the delicate need of FastPaxos & why 4 message delays are considered ""improvement"" despite MultiPaxos also only needs 4 message delays",4Xo8nv5DNS

185,It felt more natural to do that,4Xo8nv5DNS
186,But I guess you strictly abided by the Paxos protocol.,4Xo8nv5DNS
187,- 7.1 => first paragraph is complicated,4Xo8nv5DNS
188,Renaming phases and describing what they do would be helpful.,4Xo8nv5DNS
189,"- Does Unanimous PPaxos modify the ""Paxos"" protocol part? Can you explain why replicas will still converge and agree?",4Xo8nv5DNS
190,Authors set a goal to encourage an industry adoption of the multi-leader protocols so I look and evaluate the paper from a position of a practitioner trying to build a multi-leader consensus based system,4Xo8nv5DNS
191,The explanation of fast paxos and multi-leader protocols is clear and it helped me to develop an intuition for the protocols sufficient for building a prototype.,4Xo8nv5DNS
192,Overall it is a good paper: it not only refines the explanations but also introduces an abstraction helping to reason about the multi-leader consensus protocols (Simple PPaxos) and describes a new optimization / multi leader protocol (Majority Commit PPaxos),4Xo8nv5DNS
193,But the paper lacks several important characteristics necessary for building a production system:,4Xo8nv5DNS
194,  * a reconfiguration routine,4Xo8nv5DNS
195,  * information on the retrieving data from the state machines,4Xo8nv5DNS
196,  * measurable benefits of switching to from Raft/MultiPaxos to the multi-leader protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
197,## Measurable benefits of switching to multi-leader protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
198,Multi-leader consensus protocols are complex and it's harder to implement them than their leadered counterparts but in theory they have better performance,4Xo8nv5DNS
199,As a practitioner I wonder if the benefits are worth the complexity but the paper doesn't give me an answer.,4Xo8nv5DNS
200,The authors advocate that the major benefit comes as increased throughput (in Raft/Paxos a leader sends and receives disproportionately more messages),4Xo8nv5DNS
201,I recommend to include either experiment data or an estimation of the upper limits of throughput for both systems.,4Xo8nv5DNS
202,"napkin math shows that the throughput of multi-leader consensus is `(2f+1)^2/(4f+1)` times better than leadered where `f` is max allowed numbers of failures, proposer, acceptors and learners are colocated, it uses `f+1` sized quorums and the command's payload is way more bigger than the result of command execution.",4Xo8nv5DNS
203,## Retrieving data from the state machines,4Xo8nv5DNS
204,Usually production Paxos-based systems depend on bypassing the replication protocol for serving reads but the paper doesn't contain any information on how to do it,4Xo8nv5DNS
205,For example the leader-based protocols have well understood models for lightweight reads:,4Xo8nv5DNS
206,  - to read from a leader after waiting for a round of the heartbeats or after checking that its lease doesn't expire,4Xo8nv5DNS
207,"  - to read from a combination of the followers using methods from ""Linearizable Quorum Reads in Paxos"" or ""Paxos quorum leases: Fast reads without sacrificing writes"" papers",4Xo8nv5DNS
208,  - to accept a possibility of staleness and to read from any node,4Xo8nv5DNS
209,But those models aren't applicable to the multi-leader case: it lacks the leader/follower roles and local reads lead not only to staleness but to observing incompatible histories too caused by the reordering of the commuting commands.,4Xo8nv5DNS
210,The last important missing part is reconfiguration,4Xo8nv5DNS
211,It's crucial from a practical perspective,4Xo8nv5DNS
212,Without reconfiguration there is no way to replace the failed nodes and since failures are inevitable then eventually the multi-leader consensus based systems lose a majority and become unavailable.,4Xo8nv5DNS
213,One of the reasons Raft got so widespread in the industry is an included reconfiguration protocol (joined consensus) so with the declared goal I recommend to update the paper to include the reconfiguration sub-protocol.,4Xo8nv5DNS
214,"""This paper assumes that at most f machines will fail"" - from a practical standpoint it's impossible to guarantee; it's better to mention what happens then this threshold is passed if consistency or availability becomes violated.",4Xo8nv5DNS
215,"""To reach is consensus on a value, an execution of Paxos is divided into a number of integer value rounds"" - it's a clever idea to pre-assign a set of ballot numbers to the machines but using a term 'round' both for a ballot number and an act of communication is confusing",4Xo8nv5DNS
216,It may create a false impression that it's impossible to skip ballot numbers,4Xo8nv5DNS
217,"Maybe it'd be better to mention that rounds also known as ballot numbers (paxos) or term (raft) and add a reference to ""Paxos vs Raft: Have we reached consensus on distributed consensus?"" to use it as a map between different protocols.",4Xo8nv5DNS
218,This paper aims to explain the space of multi-leader consensus protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
219,The key advantage of adopting multi-leader protocols is that they facilitate out-of-order execution of commutating,4Xo8nv5DNS
220,"In specific, if two commands do not conflict, then these protocols allow replicas to execute them in their desired order",4Xo8nv5DNS
221,"To explain this space, the paper starts with a primer on SMR and Paxos, following which it explains MultiPaxos and defines the notion of conflict graphs",4Xo8nv5DNS
222,These conflict graphs are essential to the design of these multi-leader protocols as they specify the commands that can commute,4Xo8nv5DNS
223,"To explain how existing multi-leader protocols work, authors lay down two key invariants: consensus invariant and dependency invariant",4Xo8nv5DNS
224,"Next, authors gradually lay down the design of existing multi-leader protocols by presenting four of their variants: Simple PPaxos, Fast PPaxos, Unanimous PPaxos, and Majority Commit PPaxos",4Xo8nv5DNS
225,"The paper also shows how these variants can be mapped to existing protocols like Basic Epaxos, Atlas, and so on.",4Xo8nv5DNS
226,I think this paper is a timely addition to this space and has potential to become a paper like Raft that cleanly explains the domain of multi-leader protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
227,"With so many multi-leader protocols, a survey paper like this can be useful for both pedagogical and engineering purposes.",4Xo8nv5DNS
228,The first seven pages of this paper are really fun to read and insightful,4Xo8nv5DNS
229,The authors have laid down the framework very well and kudos to them for the nice description,4Xo8nv5DNS
230,"To motivate the spectrum, authors have started by explaining even Paxos, and as a reader, this really helps set up the pace",4Xo8nv5DNS
231,I found the paper as a whole to be very descriptive,4Xo8nv5DNS
232,"For each protocol, authors have presented the algorithm, an accompanying figure, and an example",4Xo8nv5DNS
233,This helps inn visualizing the problem at hand,4Xo8nv5DNS
234,"Further, the story is finely knit",4Xo8nv5DNS
235,Authors explain why Simple PPaxos is inefficient and then show how it can be improved by Fast PPaxos,4Xo8nv5DNS
236,"However, Fast PPaxos is unsafe, so there are two approaches to follow: Unanimous PPaxos or Majority Commit PPaxos.",4Xo8nv5DNS
237,I strongly believe that this paper is missing some evaluation,4Xo8nv5DNS
238,"It will be really helpful if the authors can illustrate the performance of the four protocols they have proposed against some of the protocols like Epaox, Atlas and so on",4Xo8nv5DNS
239,"Although the aim of this paper is not to evaluate performance of multi-leader protocols, graphs that illustrate the performance of the proposed variants can help understand various design choices, such as which scheme is better Tension Avoidance or Tension Resolution.",4Xo8nv5DNS
240,This paper needs some more work to clarify the different proposed protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
241,"Further, for several sections, there is a sudden switch from normal phase to recovery phase, which makes it difficult to understand",4Xo8nv5DNS
242,I explain most of my concerns next:,4Xo8nv5DNS
243,"While explaining the recovery for Simple PPaxos, the paper mentions ""unchosen vertex"" at the start of Section 4.4",4Xo8nv5DNS
244,It will be helpful if the paper explains what is meant by unchosen here,4Xo8nv5DNS
245,"Further, it is important to re-iterate how can a vertex be unchosen.",4Xo8nv5DNS
246,"I am unsure why at line 21 of Algorithm 1, the propose is sending to at least f+1 acceptors instead of all acceptors",4Xo8nv5DNS
247,"As f of the acceptors may crash, so sending to all acceptors in important",4Xo8nv5DNS
248,"It is unclear to me what is the benefit of waiting for messages from all the 2f+1 acceptors in line 1, Algorithm 3",4Xo8nv5DNS
249,The paper should explain what will be the issue if the proposer only waits for messages from f + maj(f+1) acceptors,4Xo8nv5DNS
250,I understand that the change at line helps to resolve the safety bug of Fast PPaxos but not sure why change at line 1 important,4Xo8nv5DNS
251,"Moreover, asking Unanimous Paxos's proposer to wait for messages from all the 2f+1 acceptors can hurt its liveness even if a single proposer fails",4Xo8nv5DNS
252,"In such a case, how will the proposer recover the state",4Xo8nv5DNS
253,The paper needs to clarify this scenario.,4Xo8nv5DNS
254,I think there is a typo for lines 6-7 in Algorithm 3,4Xo8nv5DNS
255,They are not identical to the lines is Algorithm 1.,4Xo8nv5DNS
256,"While explaining the Basic Epaxos optimization on Step 7, page 16, the paper states that ""pi receives 2f votes for..",4Xo8nv5DNS
257,I am not sure when did di sent a vote to pi,4Xo8nv5DNS
258,"In the presented algorithm, di only communicates with other dj",4Xo8nv5DNS
259,This step needs to be clarified.,4Xo8nv5DNS
260,It is unclear what is happening from steps (7) and (8) on Basic Epaxos,4Xo8nv5DNS
261,"So, when pi receives 2f votes it sends v to ai",4Xo8nv5DNS
262,"Then, ai records v as chosen and sends back to pi",4Xo8nv5DNS
263,"Then pi sends to all other ancestors, and waits for acknowledgments",4Xo8nv5DNS
264,"Why can't these steps be combined? Further, to reduce from 2f+1 to 2f, the Basic Epaxos optimization requires more network communication--from proposer to all acceptors and then acknowledgments from acceptors to the proposer",4Xo8nv5DNS
265,"On Page 6, the paper states Consensus Invariants, which uses the terms (x, deps(x))",4Xo8nv5DNS
266,These terms have not been mentioned anytime before in this subsection,4Xo8nv5DNS
267,"Although it can be understood by further reading, it will be helpful to the reader if explained before.",4Xo8nv5DNS
268,It will be helpful if the paper either uses the term replicas or learners,4Xo8nv5DNS
269,"The paper switches between the terms, which makes it often confusing.",4Xo8nv5DNS
270,"The following line ""We consider what happens when not every..."" on page 11, left hand side column are confusing the reader, as I expected that following this line the solution will be presented, but that happens much later in this section",4Xo8nv5DNS
271,Either consider removing this line or re-write it a little.,4Xo8nv5DNS
272,It is worth separating the recovery algorithm and not receiving enough matching votes (in Fast Paxos section) with suitable titles to improve readability.,4Xo8nv5DNS
273,I enjoyed reading this tutorial paper on generalized multi-leader state machine replication,4Xo8nv5DNS
274,The paper gives a very simple protocol that nicely captures the essence of such protocols,4Xo8nv5DNS
275,The paper then presents an unsafe protocol to set the stage for why advanced protocols work the way they do in the literature,4Xo8nv5DNS
276,"I am usually skeptical about deriving insights from unsafe protocols, but this paper does a good job with this approach",4Xo8nv5DNS
277,"However, I am not entirely certain what went wrong for Fast PPaxos",4Xo8nv5DNS
278,The paper claims that it is due to a dilemma between reaching consensus and preserving dependency,4Xo8nv5DNS
279,But it seems to me that the bug is a result of multi-leader rather than dependency,4Xo8nv5DNS
280,It seems that the bug could be avoided by simply abandoning concurrent leaders,4Xo8nv5DNS
281,"The first approach to fix this bug, increasing quorum size to 2f+1, also does not seem related to dependency; rather, it seems to be avoiding a tie between concurrent leaders",4Xo8nv5DNS
282," I would like to see more discussion on the root cause of the problem, and how exactly it is fixed",4Xo8nv5DNS
283,This is very important for the paper since at some point the authors claim that most of the design complexity comes from generalized as opposed to multi-leader.,4Xo8nv5DNS
284,"Other than that, I have a few minor suggestions in terms of presentation",4Xo8nv5DNS
285,"- When describing Fast Paxos, the authors use proposals, acceptors, and learners; but in Simple or Fast PPaxos, the authors use proposals, acceptors, and replicas",4Xo8nv5DNS
286,"I suggest the authors stick to one convention, preferrably learners",4Xo8nv5DNS
287,- Page 11 right column touched on why the threshold must be > 1.5f,4Xo8nv5DNS
288,"While this may be obvious for experts, it is helpful to elaborate on this in a tutorial paper for non-expert readers.",4Xo8nv5DNS
289,"- Section 2 says that messages can be dropped, and indeed Section 6.3  considers a situation that messages to d3, d4, d5 are dropped",4Xo8nv5DNS
290,"However, the default model of Paxos does not allow message drop",4Xo8nv5DNS
291,"Otherwise, one runs into the two-general impossibility",4Xo8nv5DNS
292,"In this particular example in Section 6.3, can we simply have p1 crash before it sends messages to d3, d4,and d5? If this is sufficient to break Fast PPaxos, then I suggest removing message drop from the model",4Xo8nv5DNS
293," If this is not sufficient, the authors need to carefully define the model regarding message drop, and explain why the two general's impossibility does not apply",4Xo8nv5DNS
294,"Overall, I like this tutorial paper and would support its acceptance as a tutorial paper",4Xo8nv5DNS
295,"However, it is currently submitted as an SoK paper",4Xo8nv5DNS
296," If judged as an SoK paper, I am less supportive",4Xo8nv5DNS
297,"The paper mentions that there are few generalized multi-leader systems, and indeed it only reviews 3 papers in detail (EPaxos, Caesar, Atlas)",4Xo8nv5DNS
298,The related work section mentions a few other works very briefly and they are not closely related,4Xo8nv5DNS
299," As such, I feel the area of generalized multi-leader state machine replication is still relatively young and small, and has not reached a stage of needing an SoK paper",4Xo8nv5DNS
300,This is not a criticism of the paper,4Xo8nv5DNS
301,I think the authors are well aware that their paper is more of a tutorial than SoK,4Xo8nv5DNS
302,The onus is on the editorial board to accept this paper under an appropriate category,4Xo8nv5DNS
303,Donut Paxos is a variant of MultiPaxos that uses separate nodes for configuration management,bXe1agiq9LN
304,It addresses the problem of missing reconfiguration protocols in academic consensus protocols,bXe1agiq9LN
305,Performance is on par with horizontal MultiPaxos and Raft.,bXe1agiq9LN
306,- This paper focuses on the reconfiguration problem,bXe1agiq9LN
307,It may give more insights on reconfiguration to readers.,bXe1agiq9LN
308,- The paper's solution is missing an important component.,bXe1agiq9LN
309,I got many questions after reading through this paper,bXe1agiq9LN
310,The primary concern is that this paper is missing a good motivation,bXe1agiq9LN
311,I agree that reconfiguration is an important piece for a consensus protocol to be practical,bXe1agiq9LN
312,"But in the industry, consensus protocols are mostly used for configuration service, which manages replicas of primary backup replication",bXe1agiq9LN
313,"Even for the case when Paxos-like consensus protocol is used for main applications, replacing a failed server can be handled by the network layer (e.g., updating DNS to redirect requests to a new server)",bXe1agiq9LN
314,Or simple horizontal Paxos-like approach may work fine,bXe1agiq9LN
315,"To motivate Donut Paxos well, there should be some explanation on why it is important to provide reconfiguration service directly within consensus protocols.",bXe1agiq9LN
316,Another problem is Donut Paxos doesn't provide a complete solution to the reconfiguration problem in state machine replication,bXe1agiq9LN
317,Donut Paxos only covers how to safely reconfigure Paxos acceptors and ensure that servers can continue to reach an agreement,bXe1agiq9LN
318,"However, the difficulty of reconfiguration comes with recovering the state machine on a new replica",bXe1agiq9LN
319,"When Google first implemented MultiPaxos, they struggled a lot with the subtleties with recovering state machines",bXe1agiq9LN
320,"(Lamport's paper doesn't cover this topic.) On the other hand, Raft could be adopted widely in the industry since it fully specified how to handle the recovery of state machines, including recovery from a snapshot (they are discussed in Diego's PhD thesis)",bXe1agiq9LN
321,"Without disclosing how to recover the state machine safely, Donut Paxos has the same problem as horizontal MultiPaxos, which will prevents the industry's adoption again.",bXe1agiq9LN
322,"Lastly, the current introduction implies that the exiting reconfiguration protocols cause performance degradation and that Donut Paxos has superior performance to them",bXe1agiq9LN
323,"However, in the evaluation section, Multi-Paxos's performance is the same as Donut Paxos's",bXe1agiq9LN
324,It was a surprise when the evaluation section admits that the performance is not the contribution of Donut Paxos,bXe1agiq9LN
325,I think this should be made clear earlier,bXe1agiq9LN
326,- Clarify contribution: I think Donut Paxos can be valuable if it can be applied to any Paxos-based protocols,bXe1agiq9LN
327,"To show that, I think it should show another example, maybe applying Donut Paxos to EPaxos",bXe1agiq9LN
328,It's a bit disappointing to see just the Multi-Paxos example as it already has horizontal reconfiguration.,bXe1agiq9LN
329,- Extend protocol to the full solution,bXe1agiq9LN
330,"If you believe that missing reconfiguration was the reason why the industry didn't adopt improved Paxos variants, you should provide the full solution.",bXe1agiq9LN
331,- I would conduct a survey on how industry people use consensus protocols and what problems they are suffering from,bXe1agiq9LN
332,"Then, Donut Paxos can be motivated more strongly.",bXe1agiq9LN
333,"""inefficient reconfiguration protocols [15, 22]"" ==> can you evaluate their performance and show Donut Paxos's performance advantage?",bXe1agiq9LN
334,"""4% effect on the median of throughput and latency measurements"" => what does it mean? Median of the whole experiment with a failure? If that's the case, medians cannot capture the reconfiguration behavior",bXe1agiq9LN
335,"If this is referring to the experiment in Section 7.1, the paper said reconfiguration completes within a millisecond, and the median was captured within one second window",bXe1agiq9LN
336,"I think that the ""4%"" number will change if a different time window was chosen",bXe1agiq9LN
337,"""MATCHA"" and ""MATCHB"" are a bit confusing.",bXe1agiq9LN
338,"""The proposer then ends the Matchmaking phase"" ==> Is there a termination guarantee?",bXe1agiq9LN
339,"""to every acceptor in every configuration in H_i"" ==> Isn't it just 1 per round?",bXe1agiq9LN
340,"In Algorithm 3, ""an arbitrary configuration"" ==> is it truly arbitrary?",bXe1agiq9LN
341,"In Algorithm 3, ""Phase 1 quorum from every configuration in H_i"" ==> what is the size of quorum?",bXe1agiq9LN
342,"This paper presents Donut Paxos, a crash fault tolerant state machine replication system with vertical reconfiguration",bXe1agiq9LN
343,"The paper motivates vertical reconfiguration convincingly, provides useful details in the design of the systems, and evaluates the system with a prototype implementation",bXe1agiq9LN
344,The paper is well written for the most part,bXe1agiq9LN
345,I have a few suggestions for further improving the paper and clarifying certain issues,bXe1agiq9LN
346,I think the paper can help the readers by motivating vertical reconfiguration early on,bXe1agiq9LN
347,"While the introduction mentions the lack of logs in certain systems, it is too terse and easy to miss",bXe1agiq9LN
348,This leaves me wondering about the motivation for vertical reconfiguration while reading the paper,bXe1agiq9LN
349,I suggest the authors moving some of nice arguments from Section 6 to the introduction,bXe1agiq9LN
350,"In addition, it would be great if the authors can also comment on whether there are downsides with vertical reconfiguration and external matchmakers",bXe1agiq9LN
351,"I am also wondering if vertical reconfiguration is fundamentally tied to external masters, or is it just the only way we know",bXe1agiq9LN
352,It would be helpful to see some discussion on this early on.,bXe1agiq9LN
353,The paper contains fairly complete details for the most part,bXe1agiq9LN
354,The only part I find a little lacking is matchmaker reconfiguration,bXe1agiq9LN
355,"Though the proof seems detailed, I need to see more details for the protocol to evaluate the proof",bXe1agiq9LN
356,"Running a Paxos instance makes sense intuitively, but how do proposers figure out current situation? For example, if one proposer shuts down the old matchmakers and immediately crashes, what do we do now? Another proposer may contact the old matchmaker and it will not hear back from them",bXe1agiq9LN
357,"How does it know if the old matchmakers have been shut down or if the messages are simply delayed? What's the criteria for this new proposer to perform a matchmaker reconfiguration? Does it directly install a new matchmaker configuration, or does it wait to hear back from the old matchmakers (which not never come because the old matchmakers have been shut down already)? ",bXe1agiq9LN
358,The experiments seem fair and thorough,bXe1agiq9LN
359,My main question here is why more clients improve throughput,bXe1agiq9LN
360,"Is it because you assume each client generates commands at some rate and you need a certain number of them to saturate the system?  If that is the case, it is better to directly use the fundamental parameter of input command rate in the figure and I see no reason to use the number of clients as an arbitrary proxy",bXe1agiq9LN
361,"If it is for some other reason, it should be explained",bXe1agiq9LN
362, Please also explain the meaning of violin plots,bXe1agiq9LN
363,"I, for one, do not know what they are",bXe1agiq9LN
364,"Below are some secondary comments on readability, clarity, and consistency",bXe1agiq9LN
365,"Paxos works in a partially synchronous network, not an asynchronous one",bXe1agiq9LN
366,"As a deterministic protocol, it is subject to the FLP impossibility",bXe1agiq9LN
367,Section 3.4 mentions that premature garbage collection can make a proposer stuck; Section 3.5 instead says premature garbage collection can be unsafe,bXe1agiq9LN
368,I think these are two sides of the same coin,bXe1agiq9LN
369,It is better to be consistent about its effect,bXe1agiq9LN
370,"On a related note, I find it more natural to talk about when to garbage collect before how to garbage collect",bXe1agiq9LN
371,"The ""Paxos Made Simple"" paper introduced three logical roles in Paxos: proposers, acceptors, and learners",bXe1agiq9LN
372,The paper adopts the first two but not the third one,bXe1agiq9LN
373,"In fact, the paper seems to use ""replicas"" to refer to learners",bXe1agiq9LN
374,I do not recommend this convention,bXe1agiq9LN
375,"To me, replicas refer to physical servers that may play multiple logical roles",bXe1agiq9LN
376,"To this end, I associate Paxos with 2f+1 replicas",bXe1agiq9LN
377,Section 4.1 says there are f+1 replicas (learners in my interpretation) is a little confusing,bXe1agiq9LN
378,"Later the evaluation section says 2f+1 replicas, adding to the confusion.",bXe1agiq9LN
379,"While I agree that configuration selection is an orthogonal issue, I think it is helpful to fix a simple configuration selection mechanism and stick to it throughout the paper",bXe1agiq9LN
380,"Currently, Section 4.2 states that leader i selects its own configuration for round i but also mentions other alternatives like an external source; the first paragraph of Section 4.3 says that leader i selects the configuration for round i+1; the last paragraph of Section 4.3 reverts back to leader i selecting the configuration for round i",bXe1agiq9LN
381,"Related to the above point, it is also helpful to fix a leader/proposer schedule",bXe1agiq9LN
382,Section 4.2 suggests each round has a (possibly different) leader,bXe1agiq9LN
383,But Section 4.4 seems to imply that the same leader is in charge of both round i and round i+1,bXe1agiq9LN
384,The Phase 1 bypassing optimization seems to apply only when a single leader is in charge of both rounds,bXe1agiq9LN
385,This makes it more important to discuss the leader schedule,bXe1agiq9LN
386,"If the same leader stays across rounds, then when do you change leaders? If you routinely change leaders, then you may need to discuss when Phase 1 bypassing is applicable, and revisit the claim that ""no commands are delayed""",bXe1agiq9LN
387,The title of section 6 is not the most suitable one,bXe1agiq9LN
388,"The section made several good insights, and generality is just one of them",bXe1agiq9LN
389,Some of the points in the latter part of Section 6 may fit better in the related work section,bXe1agiq9LN
390,"Donut Paxos is a very good paper that proposes a solution to an actual problem (a reconfiguration of the consensus based systems) which covers both the most widespread log-based systems (multi-paxos, raft) and the promising alternative systems such as EPaxos.",bXe1agiq9LN
391,It contains a lot of good practical optimizations and it will definitely benefit the community,bXe1agiq9LN
392,However I recommend doing another iteration before accepting the paper because some of its parts look misleading or contradict each other.,bXe1agiq9LN
393,"The main idea, a reconfiguration protocol, is excellent",bXe1agiq9LN
394,It takes from Vertical Paxos and then goes forward with replacing a master with a specialized linearizable replicated service which doesn't rely on consensus and has trivial reconfiguration protocol,bXe1agiq9LN
395,Also Donut Paxos  improves the GC procedure,bXe1agiq9LN
396,I find this approach much easier to understand and to reason about compared to horizontal variants such as joint consensus,bXe1agiq9LN
397,One of the interesting implications of this approach is that it helps to get rid of the control messages which often looks like gaps to an application which uses consensus as a foundation for the  replicated log service.,bXe1agiq9LN
398,Another great idea is the communication protocol between the proposers and the matchmaker services,bXe1agiq9LN
399,"It combines linearizable querying and updating into a single command, executes it with a single round trip and the protocol doesn't suffer from contention under concurrency (like dueling proposers do with Fast Paxos).",bXe1agiq9LN
400,"Last things I want to highlight is the formalization of the ""phase 1 bypass"" technique via the triple ballot numbers and the formalization of the pipelining via counting inflight requests (k)",bXe1agiq9LN
401,"Those ideas (bypass, pipelining) have been around since ""Paxos Made Simple"" but often they're left underspecified and finding info on how to do it becomes a rite of passage for an engineer implementing a consensus based system.",bXe1agiq9LN
402,What I find concerning is that the authors claim that reconfiguration takes only one round of communication,bXe1agiq9LN
403,While being technically correct it feels misleading,bXe1agiq9LN
404,Engineers measure duration of the reconfiguration from the moment it's started to the moment it's safe to shut down a node,bXe1agiq9LN
405,"Since the usual deployment of the consensus based systems in the industry consist of 2f+1` nodes with colocated roles (Etcd, Zookeeper, CockroachDB, Redpanda etc.) having the replicas running on the same nodes as acceptors requires to copy its state before turning a node off (to satisfy GC scenario #3)",bXe1agiq9LN
406,"From this position the following statements ""reconfiguring to a new set of machines takes one round trip of communication"" and ""all of our results hold in a co-located deployment as well"" contradict each other.",bXe1agiq9LN
407,Another issue is the underspecified replica reconfiguration protocol and the unclear responsibility of the replica nodes,bXe1agiq9LN
408,"The sentence ""replicas can also be safely added or removed at any time so long as we ensure that commands replicated on f+1 replicas remain replicated on f+1 replicas"" isn't aligned with ""state machine replicas execute the commands in log order""",bXe1agiq9LN
409,After reading them it's unclear whether replicas store commands after execution and how long they should do it.,bXe1agiq9LN
410,"Next issue is related to determinism of Paxos rounds: ""every round is orchestrated by a single predetermined proposer""",bXe1agiq9LN
411,"This sentence creates an impression that given a current round (a ballot number) it's possible to predict the next one but it isn't true for example after (4,""p1"") there may be (4,""p2""), (5,""p1"") or any other ballot number which is lexicographically greater than the current round.",bXe1agiq9LN
412,A related thing is using `i+1` notation for the next round,bXe1agiq9LN
413,The next round (ballot number) isn't defined until it happens so defining it as a function from the previous round isn't right,bXe1agiq9LN
414,"Also operation `+1` isn't defined on tuples (""let the set of rounds be the set of lexicographically ordered integer pairs (r,id) where r is an integer and id is a unique proposer id"")",bXe1agiq9LN
415,"It might be better to use ""next round"" instead of `i+1` or to use subscripts `r_i` and `r_{i+1}` instead of `i` and `i+1`.",bXe1agiq9LN
416,"The last disturbing part is the evaluation section: the experiment is subject to the coordinated omission problem, it's unclear why the median and IQR metrics were chosen and the conclusion is self contradicting.",bXe1agiq9LN
417,Clients wait to receive response before issuing the next command,bXe1agiq9LN
418,"This setup is subjected to the coordinated omission problem, a phenomenon when the measuring system coordinates with the measured system resulting in hiding the long periods of unavailability behind a single outlier which may be ignored even if we look at p99.",bXe1agiq9LN
419,The evaluation part lacks a discussion why median and IQR are the important metrics,bXe1agiq9LN
420,Even when the experiment is set up to avoid coordinated omission the reconfiguration still may significantly delay the requests without affecting the chosen metrics,bXe1agiq9LN
421,"For example when reconfiguration happens every second, lasts 250ms (a quarter of a second) and blocks the overlapping requests it doesn't affect IQR (a function from p75) but delays the requests by 850% (from 0.29ms to 250ms).",bXe1agiq9LN
422,The following statements from the evaluation section contradict each other:,bXe1agiq9LN
423," - ""we include the comparison to MultiPaxos for the sake of having some baseline against which we can compare Donut MultiPaxos, but the comparison is shallow""",bXe1agiq9LN
424,"- ""Donut MultiPaxos does provide performance benefits over MultiPaxos’ and Raft’s reconfiguration protocols""",bXe1agiq9LN
425,"I recommend to redesign the experiment to avoid the coordinated omission problem by maintaining the constant rate of the requests, come up with meaningful metrics (e.g",bXe1agiq9LN
426,to compare statistics like p99 and max latency of the requests overlapping with the reconfiguration and not overlapping) and back up performance benefits of Donut Paxos with numbers.,bXe1agiq9LN
427,"The paper presents Donut Paxos and Donut MultiPaxos which are a reconfigurable consensus protocol and reconfigurable replicated state machine, respectively",bXe1agiq9LN
428,The primary value of the proposed protocols that they allow quick reconfiguration of the active set of acceptors while having no performance degradation,bXe1agiq9LN
429,The proposed protocol performs reconfiguration off the critical path of standard command processing by employing a set of matchmaker processes,bXe1agiq9LN
430,"Matchmakers implement a log that stores the current and previous configurations (i.e., history of all configurations)",bXe1agiq9LN
431,"Also, Donut Paxos/MultiPaxos uses vertical reconfiguration instead of the classical horizontal configuration that is used in Paxos",bXe1agiq9LN
432,Vertical reconfiguration enables the system to perform reconfiguration quickly without the need to wait for the execution of some user commands,bXe1agiq9LN
433,The evaluation results show that Donut Paxos/MultiPaxos performs reconfiguration quickly (orders of milliseconds) and does not have any overhead on the systems performance,bXe1agiq9LN
434,The paper addresses an interesting problem that is usually poorly discussed in papers proposing consensus protocols,bXe1agiq9LN
435,I like the way in which the solution was presented starting from building a reconfigurable consensus protocol (Donut Paxos) and then extending it to build a reconfigurable replicated state machine (Donut MultiPaxos),bXe1agiq9LN
436,"Also, I commend the authors for having a detailed proof of the safety of the protocol as well as for discussing how other consensus protocols can be extended to implement vertical reconfiguration.",bXe1agiq9LN
437,"However, I mark this paper as weak reject for several reasons",bXe1agiq9LN
438,"First, I have some concerns about the novelty of the solution; you can think of the matchmakers as a separate state machine that is used to manage the configurations",bXe1agiq9LN
439,"That is, rather than having a single state machines for both user commands and configurations, Donut MultiPaxos decouples them and has one for each",bXe1agiq9LN
440,"Moreover, there are 2f+1 matchmakers and a proposer waits for f+1 (typical majority) matchmaker responses to write current set of acceptors and get all previous configurations",bXe1agiq9LN
441,"Second, this decoupling between configuration and command processing accelerates configuration changes",bXe1agiq9LN
442,"However, it increases the probability of unavailability as the availability of the commands’ state machine is tightly coupled to the availability of the matchmakers’ state machine",bXe1agiq9LN
443,"That is, if the matchmakers’ state machine is not available, a new leader/proposer cannot execute any command even if all acceptors are up and running",bXe1agiq9LN
444,The paper does not discuss this issue or evaluate it,bXe1agiq9LN
445,"Third, the paper addresses the reconfiguration of the acceptors only and do not discuss the reconfiguration of replicas",bXe1agiq9LN
446,"That is, the only place in which the paper discusses that is in the following excerpt:",bXe1agiq9LN
447,“Replicas can also be safely added or removed at any time so long as we ensure that commands replicated on f +1 replicas remain replicated on f +1 replicas.” ,bXe1agiq9LN
448,"However, I believe that the issue of making sure that commands are always replicated on majority of replicas is very tricky and this is what guarantees the safety of a replicated state machine.",bXe1agiq9LN
449,"Fourth, Donut Paxos was not rigorously evaluated",bXe1agiq9LN
450,For instance only 8 clients were used which is very small number of clients and not enough to stress the system,bXe1agiq9LN
451,"Also, the experiments do not highlight any benefits for Donut MultiPaxos over MultiPaxos in terms of throughput and latency",bXe1agiq9LN
452,"For better evaluation and better presentation of results, I suggest having a throughput-latency graph that compares Donut MultiPaxos and MultiPaxos for different number of clients and different alpha values (i.e., concurrent commands)",bXe1agiq9LN
453,The following are other minor notes I have about the experiments: ,bXe1agiq9LN
454,- The results shown in Figure 9 and 10 are confusing; why Donut MultiPaxos has higher throughput that MultiPaxos in the first 10 seconds (no reconfigurations occur)? ,bXe1agiq9LN
455,- Figure 14 and its caption does match the text used to describe it in section 7.2,bXe1agiq9LN
456,- Having Donut MultiPaxos and MultiPaxos results in the same Figure will make it easier to read and compare results,bXe1agiq9LN
457,"Finally, a minor point, I found that the text is not accurate is some places:",bXe1agiq9LN
458,"- “Many state machine replication protocol do not have logs and cannot perform horizontal reconfiguration [2, 8, 27, 30, 33]” (Introduction)",bXe1agiq9LN
459,The citations include EPaxos and Raft and both have logs.,bXe1agiq9LN
460,"- Sections 2.2 states that Paxos requires f+1 proposes, and I think it does not, and it works fine with any number of proposers.",bXe1agiq9LN
461,"- In Figure 4, should the number of replicas be 2f+1?",bXe1agiq9LN
462,- “Raft cannot safely perform horizontal reconfigurations” (Section 6),bXe1agiq9LN
463,I believe that Raft reconfiguration is based on the replicated log.,bXe1agiq9LN
464,"However, while none of the protocols have logs” (Section 6)",bXe1agiq9LN
465,"The paper presents a SOK on the subject of Serverless Computing, with the focus on the information that can be useful for application developers (as opposed to infrastructure managers)",VdWaMgaTKtX
466,"I must confess that I was unexcited about reading yet another Serverless SOK paper, but I found the perspective refreshing and enjoyed reading the (19-page!) paper.",VdWaMgaTKtX
467,The paper is structured in three big parts,VdWaMgaTKtX
468,"In the first part, the authors describe the main results of several measurement studies with the goal of helping developers with deploying and configuring their serverless applications",VdWaMgaTKtX
469,"In the second part, the authors discuss the performance vs",VdWaMgaTKtX
470,"cost trade-offs and present a set of potential applications that can leverage the performance, cost, or both aspects of serverless computing",VdWaMgaTKtX
471,"In the third and shortest part of the paper, the authors discuss future research directions for serverless computing.",VdWaMgaTKtX
472,* The ideas are presented very clearly and the paper is well written and easy to read.,VdWaMgaTKtX
473,* The insights of the authors are well described and clearly identifiable,VdWaMgaTKtX
474,"Furthermore, *most* are on-point for developers (i.e., they provide useful, concrete information that developers can use to improve their serverless applications, reduce their costs, or both).",VdWaMgaTKtX
475,* Tables 2 and 3 are novel and a very good contribution for a SOK paper.,VdWaMgaTKtX
476,"* The list of papers cited by the authors is well curated (however, I do think they've missed a small number of important--as in very relevant--papers, as I describe later in my review).",VdWaMgaTKtX
477,"* At times, I felt like the authors got confused about what is actionable for developers and what isn't",VdWaMgaTKtX
478,"It is good that developers have a SOK paper where they can read about research directions in serverless computing, but I think the authors should make a clear distinction between the things it is good that developers know about, and those that are actually things that developers can apply / use in practice.",VdWaMgaTKtX
479,"* Similar to the issue above, some parts of the paper are aimed towards researchers and not application developers (for example, describing possible research areas)",VdWaMgaTKtX
480,I feel this is fine as long as it is clear in the paper which parts are for the interest of application developers and which are aimed at researchers that wish to focus their ideas on things that would be of use to developers of serverless applications,VdWaMgaTKtX
481,"For example, future research section 6.3 is something that--even though developers could tackle themselves--is very unlikely that they would",VdWaMgaTKtX
482,"Serverless is not a common choice due to costs (not main reason) but rather due to ease of use; specifically, not having to worry about managing the infrastructure",VdWaMgaTKtX
483,"Idea 6.3, though a very good idea, is not somethings that application developers would be interested in doing (it basically adds servers back to serverless!) but rather something that should be offered by providers and also perhaps explored by academia.",VdWaMgaTKtX
484,"* Some important references are missing, see the next section of my review.",VdWaMgaTKtX
485,"* I feel that the use cases section (Section 5) is not thorough enough; e.g., it is missing important use cases like: DevOps / Maintenance tasks, HTTP APIs that interact with end user, and ETL tasks",VdWaMgaTKtX
486,"Furthermore, I think it distracts the reader from the most important parts of the paper (Sections 3, 4 and 6)",VdWaMgaTKtX
487,"Deciding to read a 19-page paper can be daunting; for this reason, I think removing Section 5 and instead pointing the reader to other studies about serverless applications (e.g., [1]) may be better",VdWaMgaTKtX
488,"However, if you do think the section is critical and want to keep it, then you should at least add an ""Other applications"" subsection and briefly mention other important use cases that developers should be aware of.",VdWaMgaTKtX
489,"* In Section 3.1, the authors talk about how serverless platforms use ""approaches [that] employ container reuse, loose isolation between function instances, and memory snapshotting and restoring to achieve a cold-start latency that is as low as 10 ms or less."" Here, the authors are missing approaches related to placement/routing/scheduling that are also used to achieve low cold-start latency (by increasing locality and thus maximizing environment re-use or benefiting from caching, in combination with placement/routing/scheduling algorithms)",VdWaMgaTKtX
490,"Examples of these are sticky routing [2], package-aware scheduling [3], and ENSURE [4]",VdWaMgaTKtX
491,There are also works related to reducing cold starts via optimal capacity planning like COCOA [5],VdWaMgaTKtX
492,"Not related to cold-starts but related to improving performance via improving locality, is the work of Bhardwaj et al",VdWaMgaTKtX
493,"* In Section 3.5, you should also cite the AWS results by Tarasov et al [7] (see Figures 8 and 9 and their explanation in the paper), who also conducted similar measurement studies.",VdWaMgaTKtX
494,"* Section 4 (Serverless Economic Model) as this is a SOK paper, I think you should cover more works that have been published on this topic",VdWaMgaTKtX
495,"For example, the work by Eismann at al",VdWaMgaTKtX
496,"[8] and the other papers they reference in their Related Work section (refs [2], [17], [39], [13], [18], [23] in their paper, though I think 1-2 of these you already have).",VdWaMgaTKtX
497,Minor nitpicks (not reasons to reject paper but would improve final manuscript quality if fixed):,VdWaMgaTKtX
498,* It is better if you don't use references as nouns,VdWaMgaTKtX
499,"Example of one place where you are using references as noun: ""Tools such as [48,49,61,98]",VdWaMgaTKtX
500,"You can change to ""Tools like X, Y and Z [...]"" or ""Other have proposed tools that..",VdWaMgaTKtX
501,"* Use dashes to join words when the words are used as adjectives, not when used as nouns",VdWaMgaTKtX
502,"Examples that should be fixed: ""one life-cycle of an application into two categories: one-time decisions and online-decisions""; in this example, life cycle and online decisions should not have dashes",VdWaMgaTKtX

512,This paper describes the state of the art of serverless from the perspective of a user/developer (as opposed to the more traditional provider perspective).,VdWaMgaTKtX
513,The collects the evaluation of aspects like the cost and the performance from other papers.,VdWaMgaTKtX
514,It also poses some open research challenges in the area and proposes high-level solutions.,VdWaMgaTKtX
515,"Overall, the paper is useful and gathers the relevant state of the art.",VdWaMgaTKtX
516,"My main concern with the paper is its structure which mixes high-level description, current research, and future work.",VdWaMgaTKtX
517,"First, I give details on these general comments and then follow with comments for each section.",VdWaMgaTKtX
518,The structure of the paper needs some work.,VdWaMgaTKtX
519,The main issue is the mix of current work and future work throughout the paper.,VdWaMgaTKtX
520,The measurements section also mixes actual content (measurement analysis) and description of the platform (belonging to the background).,VdWaMgaTKtX
521,"In each section, I am leaving some proposals on how to improve this.",VdWaMgaTKtX
522,"Given that the paper focuses on building applications on serverless, I think that FaaS should be brought up earlier.",VdWaMgaTKtX
523,"Currently, FaaS is only instroduced when discussing the economical aspect (Section 4).",VdWaMgaTKtX
524,"However, this should be clarified earlier on (maybe even in the introduction).",VdWaMgaTKtX
525,I would even argue that most of the topics discussed in the paper are more related with FaaS than with Serverless.,VdWaMgaTKtX
526,Everybody has a definition to serverless and FaaS which is fine as long as the definition is clear.,VdWaMgaTKtX
527,"From this paper perspective, I would say that the serverless aspect refers to developers not having to care about managing servers and the programming mode lwhile FaaS refers to the pricing scheme.",VdWaMgaTKtX
528,"Other variations (e.g., FaaS being the programming model) can be valid and up for interpretation but it should definetely be established.",VdWaMgaTKtX
529,The paper focuses on the execution of the functions but seems to overlook the communication aspect (across them and state with inputs and outputs).,VdWaMgaTKtX
530,"It would be good to go over what are the options for communication (e.g., messages and distributed storage) and how users would choose which approach to use and why.",VdWaMgaTKtX
531,"The introduction, states what ""an ideal SoK paper should address"".",VdWaMgaTKtX
532,I do not think making this passive helps.,VdWaMgaTKtX
533,I would suggest to directly state what this paper will address and state it as its own contributions right away.,VdWaMgaTKtX
534,An alternative would be to talk about the previous and then go into what this paper does without passively bringing it up earlier.,VdWaMgaTKtX
535,Note that SLA also refers to the penalties not only the guarantee (in contrast with SLOs).,VdWaMgaTKtX
536,The end of the background section has forward pointers which transform the section into a motivation for Section 6.,VdWaMgaTKtX
537,It might be better to make this split more explicit.,VdWaMgaTKtX
538,"In addition, it could use more structure (i.e., paragraph labels) to make the topics tackled easier to follow.",VdWaMgaTKtX
539,The beginning of Section 3 presenting the concepts of online and one-time decisions seem to belong to the background section.,VdWaMgaTKtX
540,"In Section 3.2, when explaining performance, there are a few basic explanation that seem to belong to Section 2.",VdWaMgaTKtX
541,It is also questionable if Section 3.2 should be two separate sections for cost and performance.,VdWaMgaTKtX
542,The concepts are related but there is a clear separation; separating these two section would help following the ideas.,VdWaMgaTKtX
543,Section 3.2 talks about cost and then Section 4 goes into the economics.,VdWaMgaTKtX
544,It would be good to consolidate and structure in a way that makes the paper flow into just one description of the cost model.,VdWaMgaTKtX
545,Another example of the flow of this section not being clear is the amount of footnotes.,VdWaMgaTKtX
546,Some clarifications are useful and belong to a footnote.,VdWaMgaTKtX
547,"However, most of the footnotes, should be introduced and incorporated to the main text.",VdWaMgaTKtX
548,Section 3.6 seems to also break the theme of the other subsection in Section 3.,VdWaMgaTKtX
549,I would expect it to be its own section (like the economic model) and probably earlier.,VdWaMgaTKtX
550,"Overall, the content, flow and structure of Section 3 (specially cold starts) should be improved.",VdWaMgaTKtX
551,"Most of the general concepts should be left in a shorter version of Section 3 and the rest (e.g., data related to Table 2) moved before Section 6.",VdWaMgaTKtX
552,"The concept of ""cold start"" is used in early section but it is not formally introduced until Section 3.1",VdWaMgaTKtX
553,The paper already cites [14] regarding the reclamation time.,VdWaMgaTKtX
554,"However, [14] also includes thourough studies on cold starts which should be cited.",VdWaMgaTKtX
555,Section 3.5 is very related to cold start management and this link should be tighter explicitly referring to it and probably making sections 3.1 and 3.5 to follow each other.,VdWaMgaTKtX
556,This link is even mentioned in Section 3.2 when referring to cold starts.,VdWaMgaTKtX
557,I would expect a deeper introduction of Table 1 in the text instead of referring to it 3 times.,VdWaMgaTKtX
558,At least discussing what are the most significant differences across platforms.,VdWaMgaTKtX
559,It might be a good idea to have a section describing each of the providers and describing them deeper highlighting their singularities (these nuggets are mentioned throughout Section 3 but summarizing them per provider would be valuable).,VdWaMgaTKtX
560,I cannot see the value on defining the FaaS and IaaS formulas as equations.,VdWaMgaTKtX
561,"Currently, they follow the model f(x, y, z,...) which does not bring any insight other than saying what the inputs are.",VdWaMgaTKtX
562,To present the inputs just plain text or a table comparing the two seems a better choice.,VdWaMgaTKtX
563,"Going towards the formula approach, one would give more specifics on the actual relation across ",VdWaMgaTKtX
564,The conclusions to Section 4 should be a little more nuanced and include a discussion of the provider perspective.,VdWaMgaTKtX
565,"In particular, given the observations of the previous sections, a low rate application is very expensive to maintain for the provider.",VdWaMgaTKtX
566,Another main feature for using serverless is the programming model itself.,VdWaMgaTKtX
567,"It is true that this is closely related to the ease of maintenance, scalability, etc.",VdWaMgaTKtX
568,"However, the programming model is the enabled of most of this and there are users that do not care about these aspects but choose serverless and FaaS because of how easy it is to just code a function with clear inputs/outputs.",VdWaMgaTKtX
569,There are some references to this throughout the text but the introduction of Section 5 should include this for completeness.,VdWaMgaTKtX
570,This is even mentioned in Section 5.1 but this seems to be at the same level as the features mentioned in the introduction of Section 5.,VdWaMgaTKtX
571,"When describing the applications and uses, [64] does a pretty good job at it.",VdWaMgaTKtX
572,This section should at least refer to this work.,VdWaMgaTKtX
573,The summary at the end of Section 5 is a little out of place.,VdWaMgaTKtX
574,It may need a conclusion section which compares or summarize the uses of serverless and then maps it back to the features.,VdWaMgaTKtX
575,"Otherwise, the current summary just relates to the intro of Section 5 and the other subsections do not lead to anything that strengthens the summary.",VdWaMgaTKtX
576,"At this point, it looks like the summary is just there to have the same structure across sections without a real purpose other than consistency.",VdWaMgaTKtX
577,I would suggest to split the content of the paper into two clear parts: current state and the proposal.,VdWaMgaTKtX
578,"Right now, the paper keeps pointing into the future work discussed in Section 6.",VdWaMgaTKtX
579,Section 6 can be presented in the introduction to describe the paper overall but there is no need to keep referring to Section 6 later on.,VdWaMgaTKtX
580,"Currently, these references divert from the core which focuses on the state of the art.",VdWaMgaTKtX
581,In Section 6 itself is a little confusing as it is labeled as future research when it actually cites plenty of work already happening.,VdWaMgaTKtX
582,The parameter tuning section is a pretty good example of this.,VdWaMgaTKtX
583,"I would differentiate clearly that (1) there is work already going to improve parameter tuning, (2) this work falls short in some aspects, and (3) there is some new techniques that should be explored (which this would actually be the future research).",VdWaMgaTKtX
584,This could be done by splitting each section into two or three (following the previous points) or having a section describing the current work on these areas and a separate section with a pure future research section.,VdWaMgaTKtX
585,"This SoK paper in the area of serverless computing systematizes measurement studies, summarizes a serverless economic model, discusses challenges for different classes of applications, and outlines future research directions",VdWaMgaTKtX
586,It primarily takes the perspective of an application developer (or cloud user) focusing on decisions a developer can make to influence the performance and cost of serverless applications.,VdWaMgaTKtX
587,"+ Strong focus on controllable parameters by developers linked to experimental studies (i.e., Table 2 establishing causal relationships)",VdWaMgaTKtX
588,The refinement of this classification into one-time and online decisions is helpful.,VdWaMgaTKtX
589,+ Section 3 on Measurement Studies is well developed combining a useful classification with the discussion and comparison of detailed results from multiple studies,VdWaMgaTKtX
590,It covers the most important studies in the field.,VdWaMgaTKtX
591,"- The second part of the paper (Section 4-6) could benefit from clarified purpose, improved structure, and enhanced support from existing literature (see primary comments below).",VdWaMgaTKtX
592,- The flow of the paper could be improved by reducing redundancies and keeping the writing more focused/concise,VdWaMgaTKtX
593,The paper addresses a relevant and active area of research where lots of papers have been published in the past few years,VdWaMgaTKtX
594,"While there exist (multiple) SoK papers for the covered topics (measurement studies, serverless usage, future research), it presents the broadest view on serverless computing while also summarizing detailed technical results.",VdWaMgaTKtX
595,I like the paper and have some suggestions to strengthen its second part.,VdWaMgaTKtX
596,"p3: The background information on serverless platforms (i.e., Table 1) is incomplete/outdated and inconsistent and should be verified carefully:",VdWaMgaTKtX

613,      - Castro et al,VdWaMgaTKtX

623,"However, in my opinion, Section 5 discusses interesting usage scenarios of serverless (as the section title suggests) in research rather than identifying ""best suited"" or common application classes",VdWaMgaTKtX

628,"        + feasibility: ""look at the feasibility of using serverless functions for IoT devices""",VdWaMgaTKtX
629,      One idea would be to adjust the formulation of the purpose for Section 5 more towards interesting usage scenarios that leverage serverless features,VdWaMgaTKtX
630,"The discussion of challenges and open issues would also fit better rather than contradicting a ""best fit"" application class",VdWaMgaTKtX
631,"The goal stated for an ideal SoK paper in the introduction also fits better than the current formulations in other parts of the paper: ""2) what makes serverless com- puting ideal for certain classes of applications""",VdWaMgaTKtX
632,"Related to the previous comment, ""5.5 Improving QoS of Cloud Applications"" rather sounds like a general usage scenario than a class of application",VdWaMgaTKtX
633,"Maybe a different subsection header (offloading, hybrid, idk) could alleviate this concern as I have the impression that ""Improving QoS of Cloud Applications"" doesn't fit well together with scientific workflows, ML and data processing and IoT.",VdWaMgaTKtX

650,"Section 6 (p12ff) on Future Research could benefit from a better distinction of challenges (what is the problem? maybe emphasized as question), existing work, and open issues (what remains unsolved?)",VdWaMgaTKtX
651,"I noticed its strong focus on discussing related work, which partially solve the challenges:",VdWaMgaTKtX
652,"6.1 Parameter Tuning: COSE is praised to address (most of) the raised challenges, hence a clarification of what remains unsolved is recommended here.",VdWaMgaTKtX
653,6.3 Multi-Cloud Usage: The distinction between Section 5.5,VdWaMgaTKtX
654,and Section 6.3 needs to be much clearer,VdWaMgaTKtX
655,It appears counter-intuitive to describe such frameworks and approaches as ideal/common application class in Section 5.5,VdWaMgaTKtX
656,and then reference Section 6 for further discussion of them under Future Research as well,VdWaMgaTKtX
657,Reducing the redundancies between these sections could also help to keep the discussion more focused.,VdWaMgaTKtX
658,"As a SoK paper covering multiple topics where other SoK papers exist, it could strengthen the diversity and credibility by considering existing views",VdWaMgaTKtX
659,"How do future research challenges compare to existing SoK papers? e.g., Eyk et al",VdWaMgaTKtX
660,[97] raise several issues concerning developer experience,VdWaMgaTKtX
661,Further reaching idea: Synthesize future work from primary research papers.,VdWaMgaTKtX
662,Are there other classes of applications / usage scenarios that are relevant? What about web APIs? Clarifying the purpose might be sufficient to dismiss this point because I think the usage scenarios you discuss are more interesting (but not exhaustive).,VdWaMgaTKtX
663,I would argue the paper focuses primarily on the developer's perspective but not exclusively,VdWaMgaTKtX
664,The introduction could potentially hint towards this that some findings are also relevant from a service provider's perspective.,VdWaMgaTKtX
665,"For example: Section 3.1 says that ""1) For serverless platforms: Serverless platforms can im- prove the cold-start latency by having fast sandboxing tech- niques or by keeping the sandbox instances warm for a longer time."" before talking about the developer's perspective in point ""2)"".",VdWaMgaTKtX
666,"Given you also consider open-source platforms: (How) Does the developer's perspective differ compared to hosted platforms? For example, do you consider tunable system parameters of open-source platforms in control of developers (i.e., as a serverless user) or out of control (but still controllable by sys",VdWaMgaTKtX
667,"The introduction mentions to ""augment [previous work] with our own experimental results and insights."" In the remainder of the paper, own (preliminary) experimental results are mentioned about 4 times as a side note",VdWaMgaTKtX
668,"Could it be helpful for the reader to mention how these ""own experiments"" are related to this paper?",VdWaMgaTKtX
669,I suggest introducing FaaS shortly and how it relates to serverless in the background section given you use both terms in the paper.,VdWaMgaTKtX
670,"p13: ""To the best of our knowledge, we did not come across any previous work that suggests decomposing monolithic serverless applications to optimize the cost or performance."" => Related work published in IEEE Software: Ristov et al",VdWaMgaTKtX
671,"2021 ""DAF: Dependency-Aware FaaSifier for Node.js Monolithic Applications"" ",VdWaMgaTKtX
672,"Overall, reducing some redundancies could improve the flow and keep the paper more focused",VdWaMgaTKtX
673,"p13: Cost and performance benefits of serverless have been repeatedly discussed before so I suggest removing this sentence: ""We believe that in addition to performance, serverless com- puting also offers a unique pricing model, and as discussed in Section 4, serverless computing can be cost-effective for certain demand.""",VdWaMgaTKtX
674,"p12: The limitation of ""limited control"" has been introduced in the background and extensively discussed in Section 3",VdWaMgaTKtX

676,"hardware, op- erating system, CPU-type, etc.""",VdWaMgaTKtX
677,"p2: ""The output of the serverless function is then returned as the response to the trigger."" => This description is limited to synchronous function invocations and does not hold for asynchronous invocations",VdWaMgaTKtX

679,"p2: ""A user can control limited configurable parameters, namely memory, CPU-power, and location."" => maybe a add clarifying modifier (e.g., such as memory size, ...) and/or mention that configuration capabilities differ per platform (e.g., memory is not explicitly configurable for Azure)",VdWaMgaTKtX
680,"p9: ""Summary: Serverless is more economical for applica- tions with low rate and bursty demand."" => ""bursty demand"" is not explicitly discussed in Section 4",VdWaMgaTKtX

689,I suggest clarifying that Section 4 covers the economic model by moving the section reference accordingly instead of grouping them.,VdWaMgaTKtX
690,* p3: The first paragraph of Section 3 is largely redundant with the 2nd last paragraph in Section 2 (just before),VdWaMgaTKtX
691,Consider reducing this redundancy (maybe shorten the background because it fits better into the flow in Section 3),VdWaMgaTKtX

702,Paper summary: This paper provides a systemization of knowledge (SoK) for serverless computing from a developers perspective,VdWaMgaTKtX
703,"Besides providing an overview of how function-as-a-service (FaaS) platforms work, it characterizes existing  FaaS platforms along three dimensions: their features and configuration parameters that are exposed to a user via prior measurement studies, the applications across various domains that can and are suitable for serverless computing, and future research directions that can improve the utility of serverless computing from a developers perspective.",VdWaMgaTKtX
704,"Strengths: The paper provides a comprehensive overview of research in the serverless computing domain, presented from a perspective that is useful for application developers",VdWaMgaTKtX
705,"It is also well-written, with very helpful summary/conclusion boxes summarizing takeaways for each dimension of FaaS platform they analyze.",VdWaMgaTKtX
706,"Areas of improvement: The discussion on characterization of prior studies on serverless computing provides detailed insights on what those studies found, but could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the why and how behind those findings.",VdWaMgaTKtX
707,"Comments for authors: Thank you for submitting your work to JSys’21! I enjoyed reading the systemization of knowledge — it was a well written summary of prior studies on serverless computing, with a novel application developer-driven perspective",VdWaMgaTKtX
708,"While the analysis of prior work is comprehensive, the summary boxes at the end of sections/subsections are helpful in highlighting the major takeaways from the many prior works in the space.",VdWaMgaTKtX
709,"My main suggestion for improvement for this study is to focus a bit more on the why and how behind the findings of prior work presented in the paper — currently, the text primarily focus on only what the findings are",VdWaMgaTKtX
710,"* In section 3.1, it is mentioned that the choice of programming language have performance implications — scripting languages have 100x less cold-start delays compared to compiled runtimes",VdWaMgaTKtX
711,"What is the intuitive reason behind this, and how does this impact an application developer’s choice of language? Should they always prefer scripting languages to avoid cold-start delays?",VdWaMgaTKtX
712,"* Again, in section 3.1, choice of  serverless provider is cited to impact cold-starts as well, depending on their underlying infrastructure, etc",VdWaMgaTKtX
713,"Why such a difference, and how does it vary across different cloud providers? How should an application developer reason about this choice?",VdWaMgaTKtX
714,"* In section 3.2/3.3, the summary of prior studies suggest that choice of underlying operating system, concurrency, co-location and underlying infrastructure/policies of cloud providers affect performance",VdWaMgaTKtX
715,"Again, how do they affect performance, and why? How does it factor into an application developers choices?",VdWaMgaTKtX
716,"* In section 3.4, there is a detailed description on how CPU and memory allocation is shared across various cloud providers, but the discussion on network I/O is brief — how and why exactly is network IO affected by resource configuration and co-location?",VdWaMgaTKtX
717,"There are more instances through out sections 3-6, and could benefit from brief intuitive descriptions of the underlying reason behind presented findings, and a more detailed characterization of their impact on developer choices.",VdWaMgaTKtX
718,"Second, I was a bit confused by Figure 2: is the plot obtained from real experiments, or simply a characterization? The figure is missing axes labels, and makes me believe it is the latter, although the text states “we deployed various (I/O-intensive, memory-intensive, and CPU-intensive) functions on Amazon Lambda and invoked them with varying resource conﬁgurations.” The figure is referenced for a number of resource types (CPU, memory, network, etc.) as well — do all the resources exhibit the same characteristic trend? How does it vary across different cloud providers?",VdWaMgaTKtX
719,"* Your paper is titled ‘Serverless Computing: From An Application Developer’s Perspective’, but focuses only on FaaS platforms",VdWaMgaTKtX
720,"There are other BaaS platforms that also claim to operate under a serverless model — if your focus is primarily FaaS, perhaps its better to reconsider the title.",VdWaMgaTKtX
721,"* In Section 3.1, you mention “One has to be careful with conﬁguring more resources for the serverless function to remedy cold start, as it can increase the cost of running the serverless function.” I was expecting to see a characterization of this tradeoff there, but found it in Section 3.2 instead",VdWaMgaTKtX
722,Perhaps it might be useful to provide a forward pointer in 3.1 to 3.2.,VdWaMgaTKtX
723,* The discussion on reducing/circumventing cold-start latencies talks about how serverless platforms can reduce them,VdWaMgaTKtX
724,"While this is informative, it isn’t particularly useful for an application developer, since they do not have any control over it",VdWaMgaTKtX
725,"Given your focus on application-developer perspective, perhaps it can be dropped.",VdWaMgaTKtX
726,* Section 3.5 seems to focus on aspects very closely tied to cold-starts (Section 3.1),VdWaMgaTKtX
727,Is there a reason for separating the two? I feel merging the two sections would lend depth to cold-start analysis.,VdWaMgaTKtX
728,* I really liked the summary of applications in Section 5,VdWaMgaTKtX
729,"One trend that was consistent in describing applications (which I really appreciated) was a discussion on why those applications are a good fit for serverless computing, and what challenges they face in existing platforms",VdWaMgaTKtX
730,I would suggest adding a table that summarizes these opportunities and challenges — it would really help summarize your discussion.,VdWaMgaTKtX
731,* IMO Section 5.2 is better titled as Data Analytics applications (which subsumes ML),VdWaMgaTKtX
732,"Also, the section is missing a number of recent works on Serverless Analytics (e.g., Starling [SIGMOD’20], Cloudburst [VLDB’20], etc.)",VdWaMgaTKtX
733,"Might be useful to look at this years publications that appeared after your submission (e.g., Caerus [NSDI’21]).",VdWaMgaTKtX
734,"* The paper mentions in number of places (abstract/intro, section 5, 6) that serverless platforms can lead to performance gains",VdWaMgaTKtX
735,"Specifically, in Section 5: “In addition to the ease of development, the particular pricing model and on-demand elasticity of serverless computing can beneﬁt such applications both in terms of cost and performance.”  This sentence is contradicted two paragraphs later: “However, the stateless nature of serverless functions can adversely aﬀect the cost and performance of such applications.”   As I understood it, the performance gains stem from being able to scale and provision resources faster using serverless platforms, outperforming IaaS solutions when they are underprovisioned — however, it is unlikely that a serverless realization will outperform a sufficiently provisioned IaaS solution, at least today (e.g., due to cold-start overheads, shared infrastructure overheads, etc., as you mention in Section 3)",VdWaMgaTKtX
736,It would be useful to disambiguate scalability+elasticity from performance for serverless platforms,VdWaMgaTKtX
737,* Section 6 could benefit from similar conclusion/summary boxes employed in Sections 3-5,VdWaMgaTKtX
738,This paper proposed a customizable container-based profiling framework for ML work's reproducible performance analysis,N6_kWfbABl1
739,"However, the mentioned core-hours the authors invested on each of the clusters for data gathering and analysis make me wonder about how much time it will require for a developer/researcher to perform the performance analysis of a new ML workflow",N6_kWfbABl1
740,(1) This work is precious to progress the community and ensure reproducibility,N6_kWfbABl1
741,I especially appreciate the effort to develop a modular and highly configurable framework.,N6_kWfbABl1
742,(2) The proposed framework can determine the bottlenecks of an ML workflow pipeline which will significantly help the community,N6_kWfbABl1
743,(3) The proposed analysis approach combines the approaches proposed by various previous works to provide a more holistic approach,N6_kWfbABl1
744,(4) I appreciate the rich related work section that clearly states the difference with the proposed framework,N6_kWfbABl1
745,(5) The high-level goals mentioned in Section 3.1 are well thought and clearly show the framework's purpose,N6_kWfbABl1
746,(6) The evaluation of the two clusters is thoroughly performed and considers a wide range of parameters,N6_kWfbABl1
747,(7) The manuscript is very well written and easy to follow,N6_kWfbABl1
748,(1) I am concerned about how much effort is required by the researcher/developer to utilize this framework for another ML workflow.,N6_kWfbABl1
749,(2) This manuscript does not mention whether containerization affects performance? Is there a trade-off between the reconfigurability and the efficiency of the framework?,N6_kWfbABl1
750,(3) I am curious about how and why the authors chose the parameters in Table 1,N6_kWfbABl1
751,(4) The performance analysis is done on only one model and dataset,N6_kWfbABl1
752,"I am curious how the chosen model, along with the cluster configuration, affects the bottleneck",N6_kWfbABl1
753,Point 5 of Section 5 states that the importance of preprocessing worker and batch size varies for Lisa and Cartesius,N6_kWfbABl1
754,"Though section 5.4 mentions that the under-provisioning of CPU compute to GPU compute may cause this difference, I expected such a performance analyzer to provide concrete reasoning behind each bottleneck",N6_kWfbABl1
755,(5) This manuscript does not mention whether this framework applies to clusters that share resources,N6_kWfbABl1
756,Thank you very much for submitting your work to JSys,N6_kWfbABl1
757,I appreciate the paper and think that it is a valuable contribution to the community,N6_kWfbABl1
758,"However, I am concern about the required effort to use this framework for other models and clusters",N6_kWfbABl1
759,"Following are some of the concerns I have, and I believe that addressing this will make this work stronger and more valuable to the community",N6_kWfbABl1
760,(1) It will help the community if the authors explicitly mention how much effort a developer/researcher needs to invest to use this framework.,N6_kWfbABl1
761,(2) I would love to see the overhead due to containerization in both the system—a discussion or experiment showing how the trade-off between reconfigurability and performance will be highly valuable,N6_kWfbABl1
762,(3) A discussion on how the parameters in Table 1 are selected will help the community,N6_kWfbABl1
763,(4) I will appreciate an experiment/discussion on how different models and cluster configurations affect the bottlenecks,N6_kWfbABl1
764,"Also, I will enjoy a discussion of how this analyzer can provide the reasoning behind the bottlenecks",N6_kWfbABl1
765,(5) A discussion on how this framework applies to shared resourced clusters,N6_kWfbABl1
766,"(1) In the last line of the first paragraph of Section 3.1, the number of sub-objectives should be four instead of three",N6_kWfbABl1
767,"This paper presents SURFBoard, a framework for data scientists to perform detailed performance analysis of distributed machine learning pipelines",N6_kWfbABl1
768,SURFBoard packages different profilers and ML tools into a container image and provides visualization notebooks to show and study the profiling results,N6_kWfbABl1
769,"The authors demonstrate the type of analysis that can be performed with SURFBoard by training a ResNet50 model on two different GPU clusters, collecting profiling metrics, and visualizing and analyzing the results.",N6_kWfbABl1
770,"- Tool for automated, detailed performance analysis for ML pipelines is very useful",N6_kWfbABl1
771,- Tool allows automated exploration of infrastructure parameters,N6_kWfbABl1
772,"- Evaluation has been done on two real-world, large-scale GPU clusters",N6_kWfbABl1
773,"- The exact meaning of ""reproducible performance analysis"" and how that is supported by SURFBoard is not clear enough",N6_kWfbABl1
774,- The description of SURBoard is missing several important details,N6_kWfbABl1
775,- The paper is missing a comparison to existing ML model management frameworks such as MLflow or Pachyderm,N6_kWfbABl1
776,"Thank you for submitting your work to JSys! I think your paper is filling an important gap in the currently available ML tooling space, i.e., that of providing automated, detailed performance profiling as part of ML pipeline execution",N6_kWfbABl1
777,"Being able to, as you say ""gathering performance data from all the components of the training workflow"" is useful to debug and optimize pipelines",N6_kWfbABl1
778,"This is particularly true in the case of distributed training, where collecting such metrics becomes even harder",N6_kWfbABl1
779,I liked the fact that SURFBoard allows automated exploration of infrastructure parameters,N6_kWfbABl1
780,"This is a nice feature that can be provide useful guidance to users, who would like to, e.g., retrain a model and need to size/estimate their resource requirements",N6_kWfbABl1
781,Overall I think the community would benefit from your tool.,N6_kWfbABl1
782,"However, I think there are three main issues in the current paper that should be addressed before publication:",N6_kWfbABl1
783,"While reading the paper, it never was fully clear to me, what exactly ""reproducible performance analysis"" means and why the reproducibility aspect is particularly important for ML",N6_kWfbABl1
784,Reproducibility in your case could mean a variety of things,N6_kWfbABl1
785,"For example, it could mean that individual experiments have reproducible performance across runs or that somebody else could use SURFBoard to train a model on a different cluster and achieve the same performance",N6_kWfbABl1
786,It could also mean that SURBoard can be used the same way in different environments (which would be more like the portability that you also mention in the paper) or that it collects and makes available all the necessary information (e.g,N6_kWfbABl1
787,"hardware, hardware configuration, software configuration, etc.) that is required to reproduce the performance from the initial experiment",N6_kWfbABl1
788,"Given these different potential meanings, it is important to clearly and early on define, what you mean by reproducibility in the context of SURFBoard.",N6_kWfbABl1
789,I was also missing a bit stronger motivation for why performance reproducibility is crucial for ML workloads,N6_kWfbABl1
790,I completely agree that detailed performance profiling and analysis is useful and necessary but I wasn't sure about the reproducibility part of it,N6_kWfbABl1
791,"You mention in the introduction that it is important for productivity, model and knowledge sharing, and energy efficiency",N6_kWfbABl1
792,"While the energy efficiency part made sense, I wasn't sure about the other two parts",N6_kWfbABl1
793,How does performance analysis/reproducibility help productivity or model sharing? Is it because it helps to optimize models to make training more efficient? I think it would be good to elaborate a bit more on this point to strengthen the motivation,N6_kWfbABl1
794,This issue might also resolve itself once the reproducibility meaning has been clarified.,N6_kWfbABl1
795,I felt that the description of SURFBoard was incomplete,N6_kWfbABl1
796,"After reading the paper, I didn't have a good sense for what I would need to do to deploy and use SURFBoard in my environment",N6_kWfbABl1
797,"In terms of system setup, some questions I had where: What are the different components that the system consists of, where do they need to be deployed, are they containerized or are infrastructure changes required? In terms of usage, I was wondering: What do I need to do to collect performance profiling metrics with SURFBoard, does it require code changes to my existing pipelines and how many, can I configure the collected metrics? Some of this information is missing from the paper while some is scattered across it",N6_kWfbABl1
798,I think it would be good to have one section to describe in detail the architecture and the programming model of SURFBoard to give readers a better feeling for how they could use it.,N6_kWfbABl1
799,"Related to this, it would also be good to show an example for the effort it takes to extend SURFBoard to a different ML framework, profiling tool, data loader, etc",N6_kWfbABl1
800,In Section 6 you say that extensibility is difficult,N6_kWfbABl1
801,"That is fine to have as an initial limitation but it would be good to quantify that in some way, e.g., by lines of code changes required or time it took to make the changes",N6_kWfbABl1
802,This would give users a better idea of *how* difficult adaptation would be and help them to decide whether it is feasible to deploy SURFBoard in their specific environments.,N6_kWfbABl1
803,"Finally, I was wondering, whether you considered the option of integrating SURFBoards's profiling capabilities with any of the existing ML management frameworks such as MLflow, Determined AI, Pachyderm, Polyaxon, etc",N6_kWfbABl1
804,"Those frameworks already allow for reproducible training, hyperparameter exploration, and some even collect basic resource utilization statistics",N6_kWfbABl1
805,"Would it be possible to extend those frameworks to provide SURFBoard's profiling mechanisms on top of the other features? Why would that be difficult? Some of those questions might be answered once comment 2 has been addressed but I would still like to see a more explicit discussion of ""if and how"" or ""why not"" SURFBoard can be integrated with such tools",N6_kWfbABl1
806,A distinction to those tools in the related work should also be added.,N6_kWfbABl1
807,- The last/first paragraph on page 1/2 wasn't fully clear to me,N6_kWfbABl1
808,"What are the exact reasons that new, complex ML pipelines make reproducible performance analysis more difficult? Is it because they consist of more components and have more dependencies so profiling needs to happen at many different points in the stack?",N6_kWfbABl1
809,- You mention the visualization notebooks that are part of SURFBoard,N6_kWfbABl1
810,How general are they? How easily can they be adapted to other metrics?,N6_kWfbABl1
811,- Can you better indicate the two sections of host and containerized code that you're referring to in Figure 2? I wasn't sure where exactly the boundary was.,N6_kWfbABl1
812,- What did the set up of the NVTX profiling infrastructure entail? Why was it difficult?,N6_kWfbABl1
813,- In Section 3.1 you mention that your goal is to construct a performance model for performance extrapolation,N6_kWfbABl1
814,"Is this referring to the cost model of the volume of MPI_Allreduce messages? I was expecting something more general for this, maybe one (or several) model(s) for different metrics, integrated into SURFBoard",N6_kWfbABl1
815,Would that be feasible? Are you planning to provide such a set of performance models?,N6_kWfbABl1
816,- Can you clarify what is the difference between workers and nodes? ,N6_kWfbABl1
817,- Can you provide more details on the NVTX annotations? Who needs to add those annotations? Where do they need to be added?,N6_kWfbABl1
818,- I found Figures 3 and 4 a bit confusing,N6_kWfbABl1
819,"First, it seemed that on the LISA cluster (Fig",N6_kWfbABl1
820,"4), scaling wasn't actually linear but rather started to flatten after 4/16 nodes/GPUs",N6_kWfbABl1
821,"Also, I think I got confused by the way you measure duration and I didn't fully understand why duration increases with more GPUs",N6_kWfbABl1
822,"Shouldn't it still be going down, despite the additional network traffic, as you're doubling the processing power? Or is the network the main bottleneck?",N6_kWfbABl1
823,"- The analysis of the network traffic felt a bit thin, given the amount of graphs associated to it (Figures 5-10)",N6_kWfbABl1
824,"Could you comment a bit more on the differences you observed between the different clusters? Was there anything interesting you found from looking at the network metrics? If not, some Figures (e.g",N6_kWfbABl1
825,7 and 8) could be removed to make space for some extra content,N6_kWfbABl1
826,"Additionally, the captions of those Figures are also repetitive.",N6_kWfbABl1
827,"- I was wondering, if the data in Figure 11 could be broken down further, e.g., what portion of the backward pass was network traffic, CPU/GPU data exchange, etc.? Do you think that is possible?",N6_kWfbABl1

837,Summary of the paper: This paper proposes SURFBoard a container-based solution for performance evaluation of ML workflows,N6_kWfbABl1
838,They show on two different use cases that the container can be used to generate results for a variety of performance questions,N6_kWfbABl1
839,The objective is to make it easier for users to share performance and efficiency characteristics of ML workflows,N6_kWfbABl1
840,The uses cases are comprehensive and methodology for doing experiments is well-explained,N6_kWfbABl1
841,The authors have done a comprehensive survey of related work,N6_kWfbABl1
842,The issues are in the research problem and proposed solution,N6_kWfbABl1
843,"Is the research problem with ""reproducing ML workflows"", or is it ""analysis of ML workflow performance"" or is it ""evaluation of ML workflow performance"" or is it ""profiling of ML workflow performance""? Given the proposed solution, it seems the problem is of challenges in ""sharing ML workflows and their performance results""",N6_kWfbABl1
844, Sharing a workflow raises the question of what to share and the container-based solution is an approach for improved sharing,N6_kWfbABl1
845,"In that regard, sharing is conflated with reproducing, analyzing, evaluating and profiling",N6_kWfbABl1
846,"It is not clear what is the role of reproducibility beyond portability via containers, which is a limited use of definition of reproducibility",N6_kWfbABl1
847,"In particular, how using a container, which is for isolation, aids reproducible performance? If a performance result differs on a H/W it will differ irrespective",N6_kWfbABl1
848,"further if application has library conflict with other libraries in the container, SURFBoard will not run",N6_kWfbABl1
849,"It would help if the authors describe in more detail what are the challenges behind running this framework, since they claim ""performance analysis framework is able to run and achieve significant results on multiple types of infrastructure.""",N6_kWfbABl1
850,"Is it difficult to get this framework to run because contained software has dependency conflicts and is notorious to port, or is the application using some external libraries, or if multiple types of infrastructure do not support containers or these libraries?",N6_kWfbABl1
851,The proposed solution is not compared with alternate approaches for sharing such as ,N6_kWfbABl1
852,"virtual machines (i.e., SageMaker and similar offerings from Azure) and application virtualization, which can lead to either lacking jitters in some cases, or a more light-weight solution",N6_kWfbABl1
853,Clarity: The paper lacks clarity of exposition,N6_kWfbABl1
854,Some concepts such as performance evaluation and analysis are overlapping and have not been distinguished clearly,N6_kWfbABl1
855,"The paper, in its current form, is at best vague on the specific research question that it aims to address",N6_kWfbABl1
856,The paper is unclear as to why their solution suffices?,N6_kWfbABl1
857,Originality: Building containers of complex software stacks is a recent trend to improve devops and speed deployment,N6_kWfbABl1
858,The paper shows that several HPC libraries can be part of a singularity container and this container can be successfully used to generate complex performance results often needed for HPC workflows,N6_kWfbABl1
859,"If the paper focuses on the specific research problem, originality will be more highlighted",N6_kWfbABl1
860,Significance: The work is significant as specific containers that ease sharing of complex software must be made known to the broader community,N6_kWfbABl1
861,This paper studies an increasingly important problem in open science: reproducibility,N6_kWfbABl1
862,"Instead of studying how to achieve reproducible results, this paper studies reproducible performance analysis, focusing on ML application",N6_kWfbABl1
863,"Therefore, this paper proposes a new performance analysis framework called SURFBoard",N6_kWfbABl1
864,The key contribution is to implement and evaluate this framework,N6_kWfbABl1
865,The paper argues that a large amount of implementation efforts have been made for the development of this framework,N6_kWfbABl1
866,The paper evaluates SURFBoard on one deep learning application Resnet on two large-scale GPU clusters for performance analysis to demonstrate reproducibility.,N6_kWfbABl1
867,"The paper does not do a good job in motivating and justifying why the proposed approach can make a significant difference compared to prior work, especially no insights on how this paper achieves reproducibility",N6_kWfbABl1
868,What would happen if performance analysis does not have reproducibility? How big the difference would be? These questions are not discussed or empirically evaluated.,N6_kWfbABl1
869,This paper describes the implementation details such as what hardware and software tools are used.,N6_kWfbABl1
870,This paper is not clearly written for several reasons:,N6_kWfbABl1
871,The introduction is confusing and does not deliver important information,N6_kWfbABl1
872,What is the definition of reproducible performance analysis? What is the difference between performance analysis and reproducible performance analysis? Why do people care reproducible performance analysis? What's the relationship between performance analysis and reproducibility? The paper is not clearly justify why analyzing performance of ML workflows can help reproducibility,N6_kWfbABl1
873,"""performance analysis of ML"" or similar phrases appear multiple times in the paper",N6_kWfbABl1
874,The reviewer is not sure what it means,N6_kWfbABl1
875,"What is ML in this context? ML systems, ML algorithms, or ML models? Also, the paper uses ML workloads/algorithms/models interchangeably, which is actually confusing",N6_kWfbABl1
876,"The reviewer guesses that the authors mean the same things, but the meanings of these terms are subtlety different",N6_kWfbABl1
877,The paper conducted extensive experiments of the chosen DL application on the chosen hardware.,N6_kWfbABl1
878,It is not enough to evaluate only one workload in only one domain with one software in system paper evaluation,N6_kWfbABl1
879,There is no baseline for comparison,N6_kWfbABl1
880,"In a rare case, it is fine if the proposed work studies a new problem that no prior work has studied before",N6_kWfbABl1
881,"But, this paper studies reproducible performance analysis",N6_kWfbABl1
882,"What kinds of metrics in the evaluation can reflect the reproducibility? Actually, it goes back to the initial question: what is the definition of reproducible performance analysis? How do you justify that the proposed approach has reproducibility? Are the metrics good enough to compare reproducibility? The reviewer cannot find the answers in the evaluation.",N6_kWfbABl1

For these scenarios, give evidence to explain the unusual behavior, such as why ALCC-based Verus in Figure 13 achieves higher throughput than Verus between 100-150 seconds",moVPhXtxQo7
1094,"Describing a hypothesis without a quantitative proof (""ALCC indirectly reduces the chances ..."") or using words like ""surprisingly"" does not help shed light on the phenomenon.",moVPhXtxQo7
1095,"- Even under the setting of stochastic packet losses, I doubt ALCC-based CC algorithms can always reach a higher throughput as shown in Figure 13",moVPhXtxQo7
1096,"E.g., if an algorithm were informed a 10% random packet loss beforehand (on a link with infinite bandwidth), then it could leverage FEC and send 10% extra redundancy packets to maintain a high goodput",moVPhXtxQo7
1097,"However, ALCC would have limited its sending rate to the underlying TCP's data rate, which would be extremely low under such a high loss rate",moVPhXtxQo7

1115,"- Thank you for the replies to my comments! I agree that there is value in the server-side ALCC library, but it still sounds possible and straightforward to implement Sprout on top of a non-blocking TCP socket without the need of ALCC's client/server library, so long as it operates at a lower speed than TCP with the help of TCP's blocking signal",moVPhXtxQo7

1119,This paper presents an interesting system ALCC which implements congestion control for cellular networks in the application layer,moVPhXtxQo7
1120,"I like the idea of moving congestion control to user space, which can significantly accelerate the adoption of new congestion control algorithms",moVPhXtxQo7
1121,"However, I have the following concerns:",moVPhXtxQo7
1122,"The authors implicitly assume that cwnd of kernel TCP (e.g., Cubic) should be larger than cwnd of application layer, which ALCC wants to enforce",moVPhXtxQo7
1123,"Thus we have cwnd of ALCC = min(cwnd of kernel TCP, cwnd of application)",moVPhXtxQo7
1124,"This assumption may not always hold in practice, e.g., Cubic significantly reduces the congestion window due to small switch buffer and non-congestion packet losses (e.g., bit errors, failures)",moVPhXtxQo7
1125,It seems to me that ALCC lacks a general method to support customized ACKs required by various cellular network congestion control algorithms,moVPhXtxQo7
1126,The solutions in 4.1.3 seem very ad hoc to me,moVPhXtxQo7
1127,I worry that this can limit the scope of congestion control algorithms that can be supported by ALCC.,moVPhXtxQo7
1128,ALCC provides different APIs compared to legacy socket,moVPhXtxQo7
1129,This introduces non-trivial modifications to migrate an application to ALCC,moVPhXtxQo7
1130," Instead of assuming kernel TCP's window is always large enough, I suggest the authors enforcing a static high window size in kernel TCP, thus 'disabling' kernel TCP congestion control",moVPhXtxQo7
1131," This should be easy to implement using a loadable Linux kernel module, like what you do in 4.1.2.",moVPhXtxQo7
1132,"Instead of exposing customized APIs to applications, I suggest the authors using LD_PRELOAD to translate legacy socket APIs to ALCC APIs",moVPhXtxQo7
1133,I hope the authors can summarize how to support customized ACKs in a more principle way,moVPhXtxQo7
1134,and 4.1.3 seem very unclear and ad hoc to me,moVPhXtxQo7
1135,I like your observation that Android imposes restrictions on modifying kernel in section 4.3,moVPhXtxQo7
1136,"But the solution described in 4.3 is not so related to 4.1 and 4.2, and lacks many important details",moVPhXtxQo7
1137, I suggest the authors moving 4.3 to discussion,moVPhXtxQo7
1138,Client/Server seem a little bit confusing as both client and server can send and receive data,moVPhXtxQo7
1139,There are many high performance user space network stacks designed for cloud environment,moVPhXtxQo7
1140,"Many of them can support legacy socket APIs without requiring any application modifications, e.g., Mellanox LibVMA",moVPhXtxQo7
1141,Why not port them to cellular devices and implement congestion control algorithms on the top of them? I suggest the authors discussing these solutions in the paper,moVPhXtxQo7
1142,Thank you for submitting your paper to JSys! Overall I really like the idea of implementing the congestion control algorithms within the application layer to eliminate the overhead of deploying new algorithms,moVPhXtxQo7
1143,The paper is also interesting in,moVPhXtxQo7
1144,+ interesting idea and pragmatic solution,moVPhXtxQo7
1145,+ thorough evaluation with three well-known congestion control algorithms,moVPhXtxQo7
1146,- implementation cost in kernel ,moVPhXtxQo7
1147,- limitations in the scope of deployable algorithms ,moVPhXtxQo7
1148,"I'm little confused about the implementation of ALCC, similar to the reviewer 48B from Eurosys",moVPhXtxQo7
1149,"From my understanding, ALCC still need kernel patches (as introduced in Section 4) to realize its function",moVPhXtxQo7
1150,I understand that such a patch is much more lightweight than implementing a new cc from the scratch,moVPhXtxQo7
1151,"However, now that the kernel still needs modification (no matter a large patch or a small one), what's the difference for operators?",moVPhXtxQo7
1152,A suggested experiment: what if fix the congestion window to the maximum value and fully let the application layer takes over the control? I'm wondering if (and how much) the underlying cubic is still effective when the ALCC works above.,moVPhXtxQo7
1153,"Besides, a key assumption in this paper is that the cubic always maintain a higher cwnd than other algorithms, which needs more convincing analysis",moVPhXtxQo7
1154,"The authors try to explain that cubic *usually* maintains an unnecessarily high cwnd, which is different from *always*",moVPhXtxQo7
1155,"Since the performance difference between algorithms usually depend on their actions in these corner cases, it would be better if the authors could provide more convincing arguments (theoretical analysis, or the detailed investigation on cwnds) on this.",moVPhXtxQo7
1156,My understanding of the assumption above is that cubic is the most *performance-oriented* algorithm compared to the three algorithms evaluated in the paper,moVPhXtxQo7
1157,"However, there are indeed some other algorithms that are more aggressive in throughput than cubic (e.g., bbr or a finetuned pcc towards throughput)",moVPhXtxQo7
1158,It would be better to discuss and clarify the scope of ALCC.,moVPhXtxQo7
1159,"- Since ALCC controls the deliver of packets at the application layer, introducing such a new queue at the application layer might increase the end-to-end delay",moVPhXtxQo7
1160,It would be better if the authors could explain or measure such influence in detail.,moVPhXtxQo7
1161,- I fully agree with the authors that ALCC could ease the efforts for operators to implement new congestion control algorithm,moVPhXtxQo7
1162,"However, instead of human work days, it would be more straightforward if the authors could present other quantitative metrics (e.g., line of codes).",moVPhXtxQo7
1163,- Another thing I don't understand is related to the zero-byte claim in the paper,moVPhXtxQo7
1164,"How could the newly added header (introduced in Section 4.3) be zero-byte? If ALCC is encapsulating / decapsulating within the protocol stack, will such operators increase the overhead? If not, will such a header be delivered over the network? ",moVPhXtxQo7
1165,The paper presents a very interesting approach to generalizing PBFT,kCKRUcUGSup
1166,"It claims one primary contribution: higher-performance (throughput, specifically) BFT TOB, which is unaffected by request duplication attacks",kCKRUcUGSup
1167,"The system is called SRB and there is a thorough protocol description, some proofs of correctness, and system evaluation",kCKRUcUGSup
1168,The evaluation is quite extensive though some details could help improve it,kCKRUcUGSup
1169,"In general, the paper is well-written but is missing some important details and clarifications",kCKRUcUGSup
1170,"The style and presentation is mostly clean, but the authors rarely make efforts to simplify and make the topic accessible (i.e., ""Only experts can understand the paper"")",kCKRUcUGSup
1171,"In this sense, there is room for improvement before it can be considered a quality publication.",kCKRUcUGSup
1172,"I think the paper is relatively strong and very interesting, but has multiple serious flaws",kCKRUcUGSup
1173,"It's possible that these flaws can be simply fixed by being more clear, but it's also possible some more extensive experiments would be necessary (wrt",kCKRUcUGSup
1174,"batching, Chain's performance, and the dubious claim of ""best throughput to date"")",kCKRUcUGSup
1175,I remain optimistic that the authors can fix them within ~3 months.,kCKRUcUGSup
1176,"- It would improve the quality of the paper if you are more precise early on (Intro) about which ""state-of-the-art BFT"" systems you are comparing to.",kCKRUcUGSup
1177,- The major novelty seems to be in preventing request duplication attacks.,kCKRUcUGSup
1178,"    - If I understand correctly your solution, I would propose that the concept of a ""duplicate request"" does not make much sense in the context of an ordering service (which is what SRB is)",kCKRUcUGSup
1179,"Concretely, your interface is `BCAST(r)` which a client calls once for every distinct `r`",kCKRUcUGSup
1180,"Duplicates make sense when there is a higher-level abstraction, e.g., commands (like in an SMR) or transactions (like in a UTXO model), and in that case you could say that two inputs to the service are duplicates",kCKRUcUGSup
1181,But if a client calls `BCAST(r)` twice with identical input `r` the service is agnostic to it and should treat each call as a separate request and should order the same `r` twice.,kCKRUcUGSup
1182,    - This clear distinction as to what is a duplicate request in your model is lacking and clarifying that would be a great improvement to your paper.,kCKRUcUGSup
1183,"- In general, it is more valuable to show fewer evaluation results if that means",kCKRUcUGSup
1184,  that they are higher quality and more thoroughly explained.,kCKRUcUGSup
1185,    - Some questions and suggestions below...,kCKRUcUGSup
1186,"    - I find it surprising that SRB manages to beat Chain consistently, except for the cluster environment (where Chain uses MACs, Fig.7)",kCKRUcUGSup
1187,"Is it because Chain has no batching? This may be an important detail you overlooked, so please clarify.",kCKRUcUGSup
1188,"    - SRB implements a total-order broadcast, while some of your competitors (PBFT, from [15], for instance) do more than total-order and also have an execution engine",kCKRUcUGSup
1189,"Is that engine disabled? Or is the overhead from passing transactions through an execution step still present in some competitors, while SRB omits that? It would be good to clarify since this is important.",kCKRUcUGSup
1190,"    - You mention that the VMs have a 1Gbps network and I'm trying to understand how does that translate into Chain's throughput in Fig.4(a), since you pointed out that the bottleneck is probably the weakest link",kCKRUcUGSup
1191,"A back of the envelope calculation shows that this link is using around 20000 (req/s) * 500 (bytes) = ~0.08 Gbps, which is one order of magnitude smaller than the theoretical bandwidth you have of 1Gbps.",kCKRUcUGSup
1192,"    - If Chain's performance is indeed limited by the weakest link, then I would expect in a growing network size to see lower and lower throughput, since there would be higher chances of traversing weaker links",kCKRUcUGSup
1193,"But Fig.4a shows roughly fixed (or even growing) throughput for ""Chain-500b""",kCKRUcUGSup
1194,"  - Some other recent papers also claim ""excellent performance"", and some do evaluation on even larger setups (~200 nodes)",kCKRUcUGSup
1195,I am thinking of [25] and [33] for example,kCKRUcUGSup
1196,"It would have been good if you compared against them in an evaluation, since that would prove your case of ""best throughput to date on public WAN networks""",kCKRUcUGSup
1197,"With the present evaluation, your claim is not on a very solid ground",kCKRUcUGSup
1198,"You could just rephrase that to be accurate by saying ""best throughput among the systems we evaluated""...",kCKRUcUGSup
1199,"- Section 9.4 is impressive in showing the importance of preventing duplicate requests, though as I mentioned earlier I believe the definition of a ""duplicate request"" should be clarified, since this seems something specific to your system and not a concern in your competitors (PBFT, HotStuff).",kCKRUcUGSup
1200,"- I appreciate that you took the effort to put the pseudocode of PBFT in section 6, and also that of SRB",kCKRUcUGSup
1201,"But it would be more valuable and respectful for the readers (and reviewers) if the pseudocode was explained in text, e.g., you could weave the algorithms with your text of section 5 (and 3), and in that way the two sections could support each other consistently.",kCKRUcUGSup

1221,"- "" While many successor BFT protocols eliminated watermarks in favor of batching (e.g, [13, 16, 39])""",kCKRUcUGSup

Suppose we simply run X concurrent instances of PBFT among the same N nodes, and each instance `i` of PBFT writes its client requests in a specific log (no execution of client requests, just log them in a database/file), then a separate process would merge these log files deterministically, in the same manner at all N nodes?",kCKRUcUGSup

1246,This paper aims to scale existing BFT consensus protocols by allowing multiple each node to act as a leader and run independent consensuses in parallel,kCKRUcUGSup
1247,"To achieve this task, the paper proposes SRB that follows the seminal PBFT protocol and runs up to n instances of PBFT in parallel",kCKRUcUGSup
1248,"In each epoch, one of the replica is chosen as the primary, and the primary chooses a set of epoch leaders",kCKRUcUGSup

1253,This paper represents a timely problem as it is critical to design BFT protocols that are not dependent on a single primary,kCKRUcUGSup
1254,SRB bolsters system throughput and facilitates load balancing by allowing multiple leaders to propose requests in parallel.,kCKRUcUGSup
1255,The paper is easy to read and clearly motivates the problem at hand.,kCKRUcUGSup
1256,The paper presents a good set of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of SRB against the presented protocol,kCKRUcUGSup
1257,"Further, the paper includes a set of failure scenarios, which have been explored well during experimentation.",kCKRUcUGSup
1258,"My main concern with this paper is that it completely misses the state-of-the-art protocols, such as Omada[1] and RCC[2][3], which also parallelize consensus",kCKRUcUGSup
1259,"Hence, this is not the first paper to allow up to n nodes to run consensuses in parallel as claimed by the paper",kCKRUcUGSup
1260,Omada was the first paper to allow up to n nodes to propose requests in parallel,kCKRUcUGSup
1261,"In recent years, RCC has been proposed which does the similar tasks with some improvements under failures",kCKRUcUGSup

1265,The paper highlights the ability of a byzantine client to send duplicate requests as a major concern for the multiple leader protocols,kCKRUcUGSup
1266,"To resolve this challenge, the paper presents the bucket distribution scheme as a novel solution",kCKRUcUGSup
1267,"Although this solution works, RCC handles this problem in a similar manner by dividing clients equally among the leaders",kCKRUcUGSup

1269,"Hence, it is important to understand the effectiveness and costs of both the schemes.",kCKRUcUGSup
1270,The paper presents no discussion on request execution,kCKRUcUGSup

1275,How much time do nodes have to wait for executing requests post failures.,kCKRUcUGSup
1276,"Although SRB can recover itself from the failure of its leader nodes, it presents a blocking design where failure of one leader causes the epoch to change",kCKRUcUGSup
1277,During this epoch change all the leaders have to stop proposing new requests and the nodes can no longer execute requests until the system is recovered,kCKRUcUGSup
1278,RCC on the other hand proposes a design where failure of one leader allows other leaders to continue proposing requests as the view change is localized and there is no notion of epoch change,kCKRUcUGSup
1279,"Hence, it is important that the paper illustrates the performance of SRB against RCC under such failures",kCKRUcUGSup
1280,"In Section 5.6, SRB adds a tricky optimization",kCKRUcUGSup
1281,"When a failure-free execution starts observing simple failures, message delays or loss, even if a replica has sufficient number of Prepare messages, it will continue waiting until timeout for Prepare from the selected f+1 replicas to arrive",kCKRUcUGSup

1293,Such variations may be difficult to understand for a reader who is not well-versed with the working of both the PBFT variants.,kCKRUcUGSup

1297,"Sadoghi, RCC: Resilient Concurrent Consensus for High-Throughput Secure Transaction Processing, ICDE 2021 [arxiv]",kCKRUcUGSup
1298,This paper presents a BFT system that has concurrent leaders proposing request batches in order to improve the throughput via parallism,kCKRUcUGSup
1299,"The paper makes commendable efforts in providing detailed pseudocode, correctness proofs and evaluation results",kCKRUcUGSup
1300,But the paper also has several issues that need to addressed in a revision,kCKRUcUGSup
1301,The paper claims that no prior work has ever studied parallel leaders with duplicate prevention,kCKRUcUGSup
1302,I have doubts about this claim,kCKRUcUGSup
1303,The HoneyBadger BFT paper discussed this exact matter,kCKRUcUGSup
1304,"It uses a common subset procedure that commits multiple proposals, and also has a discussion on avoiding duplicates",kCKRUcUGSup
1305,The solution is very similar to this paper: assign requests to proposers using a hash function,kCKRUcUGSup
1306,And I think the HoneyBadger paper credits even earlier papers for observing this challenge and solution,kCKRUcUGSup
1307,The authors should cite those papers and reconsider the how novel this method is,kCKRUcUGSup
1308,"To be honest, even without those prior works, I find the idea of hash partitition straightforward",kCKRUcUGSup
1309,"Once you employ the hash partitioning, a client request is only assigned to one single node",kCKRUcUGSup
1310,This raises the natural issue  that a Byzantine node can now censor a transaction,kCKRUcUGSup
1311,"The paper touts censorship resistance as a main feature of the system, but the solution here (reassigning buckets) is also quite straightforward and a bit underwhelming as it allows Byzantine nodes to censor a transaction for f ""periods""",kCKRUcUGSup
1312,"Given the above, I suggest the authors tone down claims about proposing certain designs or addressing certain attacks for the first time",kCKRUcUGSup
1313,The paper makes solid contributions by implementing simple and natural (and likely existent) ideas of random request assignment and demonstrating improved performance over existing systems,kCKRUcUGSup
1314,This is strong enough for a systems paper,kCKRUcUGSup
1315,The paper uses vanillar PBFT as the baseline in an overly rigid fashion,kCKRUcUGSup
1316,"While BFT is undoubtedly a seminal work, it has been more than two decades since it invention",kCKRUcUGSup
1317,There has been a lot of progress and new understanding since then,kCKRUcUGSup
1318,"More notably, the PBFT view change has been improved by the Tendermint and HotStuff paper",kCKRUcUGSup
1319,I suggest the authors incorporate the latest progress in BFT,kCKRUcUGSup
1320,"For a few minor points, it seems unnecessary to emphasize that PBFT has no batching",kCKRUcUGSup
1321,It is pretty obvious how to add batching to PBFT and PBFT-style protocols,kCKRUcUGSup
1322,"In terms of the writing, while it is commendable that the authors provide super detailed pseudocode and proofs, I have to say they are not very helpful to a reader",kCKRUcUGSup
1323,The code is too detailed and low level,kCKRUcUGSup
1324,Most of the steps in the code and proofs are adopted from PBFT and hence are not really useful to understanding this paper,kCKRUcUGSup
1325,It also goes against the idea that SRB simplifies the reasoning by building on top of a well understood system,kCKRUcUGSup
1326,"In that spirit, it will be more helpful if the authors can pinpoint and highlight the differences to PBFT in the pseudocode and proofs",kCKRUcUGSup
1327,"Section 3 mentions ""bottlenecks"" in the title but did not discuss them",kCKRUcUGSup
1328,Section 4: the third paragraph makes it sound like batching and watermarking are two competing and incompatible approaches,kCKRUcUGSup
1329,I don't think that is what you mean there,kCKRUcUGSup
1330,"Page 5 says that the primary ""reliably broadcast"" its selection",kCKRUcUGSup
1331,"It is unclear what ""reliable"" means here",kCKRUcUGSup
1332,Do you mean Bracha-style reliable broadcast?,kCKRUcUGSup
1333,It is mentioned that  leaving  the payload out of the hash can prevent  the client from manipulating the bucket assignment,kCKRUcUGSup
1334,This is not clear as the client still has control over the timestamp and may still manipulate to some degree.,kCKRUcUGSup
1335,Section 8 feels like a rather minor point ,kCKRUcUGSup
1336,"If some nodes do not need to commit the request, one can think of request hash as the ""committed values"" and the totality property naturally follows",kCKRUcUGSup
1337,"The paper presents a BFT total order broadcast system targeted for the support of blockchain systems, particularly for permissioned systems and as a module for agreement in Proof-of-Stake permissionless systems",kCKRUcUGSup
1338,"While this is a crowded area of research, I believe the paper and the system it describes, SRB, presents an interesting combination of technology and delivers a system that improves performance over competing approaches",kCKRUcUGSup
1339,"The target environment is for planet scale networks, and was evaluated up to 100 nodes",kCKRUcUGSup
1340,"While it excels in WAN settings, the protocol also shows decent performance in LAN settings, albeit with lower throughput wrt the competing best algorithm",kCKRUcUGSup
1341,The design is based on the classic PBFT protocol and makes possible the use of parallel leaders and to distribute the verification of client signatures,kCKRUcUGSup
1342,"Correctness is based on the correctness of PBFT core algorithms, which brings some confidence on the properties given the high complexity of this kind of systems and the difficulty of evaluation for manual proofs, as is the case here",kCKRUcUGSup
1343,"Even so, most arguments look sound and decisions taken looks rooted on solid grounds",kCKRUcUGSup
1344,I also appreciated that the protocol generalizes PBFT and allows emulation of other protocols,kCKRUcUGSup
1345,The text itself is well written and I only detected minor issues that should be simple to correct,kCKRUcUGSup

1372,* New problem potentially opening another subspace for video streaming research,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1373,* Considers both segmentation and augmentation leveraging both heuristics and simulation-based techniques,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1374,* Improvement numbers are not very large,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1375,* Other components beyond chunking are not tuned to best fit variable-length segments and variable numbers of tracks,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1376,* Experiments are mostly based on simulation,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1377,Thank you for submitting SEGUE to JSys,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1378,The argument for adding more flexibility to ABR chunking is backed up by a simple yet effective scheme that carefully segments videos and creates different numbers of versions for different segments,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1379,Overall this is a decent paper and I have a few comments as follows.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1380,The idea of having more chunking flexibility is great,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1381,"Two challenges exist: (1) how to tailor other parts of the video streaming ecosystem (including player logic, ABR algorithm modeling & parameter tuning, QoE function definition & metrics, etc) to make them aware of that and avoid bad interactions, (2) how to optimize chunking given such flexibility",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1382,"As much as I appreciate the efforts the paper made in addressing the second challenge, I feel there is a lack of detailed justification on the first one, which IMO is even more important in the infancy of this big idea (people will first question this first part too)",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1383,"Without this part being clearly fleshed out, the numbers measured for a specific encoding won’t represent its real performance when everything works in synergy.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1384,SEGUE’s use cases need to be more explicitly specified,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1385,Does SEGUE only work for video-on-demand (VoD)? How about live streaming? One challenge for live streaming is that there may not be enough time to run SEGUE and the video complexity information over the entire duration (especially the future scenes) to carefully form tracks,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1386,"How well would SEGUE work when the ABR algorithm is learning-based, e.g., Pensieve and Fugu? Some platforms randomly choose the ABR algorithm, e.g., Puffer, in this case, whenever an ABR algorithm is chosen, you also need to choose a corresponding ABR track ladder? How do you realize that? Seems that it may need extra control messages in order to inform the server what ABR algorithm the client is currently using.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1387,SEGUE causes extra preparation time overhead when searching for good chunk boundaries for segmentation,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1388,Did you evaluate that? This is something Youtube and other open video platforms need to consider as they receive a lot of video uploads every minute and need to encode them ASAP,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1389,"Some services can have more than one ABR algo deployed, each for a specific platform (e.g., web v.s",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1390,"Mobile, or different versions of players), in this case, do you need to prepare another version of tracks for another ABR, which may be too overwhelming? ",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1391,"Need to mention QoE function adjustment early (currently the authors do not mention it until Section 6), otherwise readers will question Fig",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1392,3 in Section 3.2 where the y-axis is QoE yet there is no reasonable definition of QoE for variable-length-segment ABR tracks yet before Section 3.2.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1393,"SEGUE's benefits over existing studies (e.g., [24, 28]) are not quantified with experiments, in terms of a better tradeoff between performance and storage overhead",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1394,The benefits of segmentation and augmentation are only evaluated separately.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1395,Network traces are classified into three categories based on mean bandwidth value,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1396,Might also be good to do some classification based on bandwidth variability across time.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1397,What if a user starts playing a video from the middle instead of the beginning? Will SEGUE’s prediction cause bad behavior and QoE？,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1398,The “Other work” paragraph in the related work section is a bit confusing,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1399,"Salsify [7] seems not very related, not sure how it relates to SEGUE",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1400,It mostly focuses on bitrate/frame-rate adaptation rather than segmentation adaptation,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1401,It is also not the first to propose adaptive video conferencing encoding -- WebRTC has been doing that for a long time,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1402,"“To avoid the effects of startup behavior, we show results starting at the 25th segment, i.e., 125 seconds into playback.” It may also be worthwhile to look into the first 125s to understand the startup behavior",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1403,"125s is not short, and nowadays short videos are the most popular ones so optimizing them considering the startup behavior (instead of “avoiding” it) would be more valuable practically speaking.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1404,1: labels are not descriptive enough,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1405,Y-labels could use more text to denote the ABR algo and other info,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1406,"Also fig 1(bcd) could use another set of colors than fig 1a, to avoid establishing wrong mappings at readers’ first glance.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1407,2(a): why during 5-10s key frames do not occur frequent despite highly varied bitrates (motions)？,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1408,"3: care to explain why videos A and D behave differently using the same ABR? Also, are these two videos same as video A and D in Table? If so, a forward pointer could be helpful.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1409,6: how is VMAF stability defined?,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1410,"“However, we use this implementation only to verify the fidelity of an orders-of-magnitude faster simulator, which we use for extensive experimentation.” Don’t you also use a real player for video playback in extensive experimentation? Or the extensive experimentation is simulation only? ",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1411,"“Appendix E details the DASH player implementation, demonstrating that it achieves results near-identical to the simulator.” This demonstration was based only on video A, not sure if it generalizes to other videos.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1412,"“For the segments highlighted in pink, there is a huge fluctuation in VMAF within the segment boundaries,” true but why do users care? Users don’t even know where the segment boundaries are.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1413,"“There can also be value in synchronizing these change points with segmentation, allowing more informed adaptation decisions that account for such changes.” could use some concrete examples to better argue for this.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1414,"“RMPC’s implicit assumption that a certain number of segments comprises a long-enough future planning horizon....” I wouldn’t say RMPC assumes that a certain number of segments comprises a long-enough future planning horizon, rather, how to adapt RMPC to a different setting has nothing to do with the RMPC algorithm itself, and the RMPC paper itself never said you should always use 5 segments as lookahead in any situations (e.g., for ABR track ladders with longer/shorter fix-length segments and for those with variable-length segments).",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1415,"“Adaptive bitrate video streaming comprises two pieces, video encoding, which runs offline at the content provider, and...” May need to mention this offline nature of encoding only applies to VoD",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1416,"“Unfortunately, our requests for CAVA’s code were unsuccessful” Why mention this?",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1417,“It is unclear to us how or if QoE functions should reward such local improvements.” You may also want to mention you are the first (AFAIK) to put VMAF values into the QoE function so summing over them could be different from summing up bitrate values.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1418,"Some of the paper info in Reference (e.g., [10], [11], [14], [25], [31]) are incomplete.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1419,“too many bytes or two few bytes are undesirable”=>”too many bytes or too few bytes are undesirable”,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1420,“and their QoE function is used rank the candidate chunkings” => “and their QoE function is used to rank the candidate chunkings”,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1421,“providers also want to contain infrastructure costs” => ”providers also want to constrain infrastructure costs”,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1422,Thanks for the interesting and well-written paper! I,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1423,appreciated the exploration of the design space of,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1424,segmentation and augmentation and the evaluation on real,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1425,The main concern I have with this paper is that the levers,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1426,"used in this paper, segmentation and selective augmentation,",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1427,are proposed without clear reasoning towards why these are,iUU6Qr3eQd6

1434,"In many parts, the methodology feels ad-hoc (setting",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1435,I further feel that the paper,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1436,should do more to justify the tradeoffs it achieves (x% more,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1437,"storage and pre-computation for y% QoE improvement), since",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1438,the proposed strategy does not dominate existing,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1439,There are definitely some clear sparks of ideas in this,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1440,"However, IMHO the paper could use more thought into",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1441,its presentation and reasoning for the advocated,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1442,I hope that the authors could improve these,iUU6Qr3eQd6

1444,Regarding augmentation: I couldn't follow why using more,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1445,bitrate tracks for specific scenes (but not the whole video),iUU6Qr3eQd6
1446,Is the idea to reduce storage at the video,iUU6Qr3eQd6

1448,Perhaps the authors could quantify how much reduction in,iUU6Qr3eQd6

1450,"The terms ""playback context dependence"" is nebulous in the",iUU6Qr3eQd6

1452,least provide an example how this information is used.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1453,Industry efforts: Is SEGUE's idea just to capture a subset,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1454,of the fixed bitrate tracks? that are available at the video,iUU6Qr3eQd6

1463,One conclusion that a reader could make from plots Fig1(c),iUU6Qr3eQd6

1537,This paper seeks to optimize video streaming by offline video chunking -- adjusting lengths of video segments (segmentation) and introducing additional quality levels to the bitrate ladder (augmentation) in a manner that improves QoE,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1538,"The proposed technique, Segue, features the awareness of the video sequence context and the provider-specified ABR algorithm",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1539,"By accounting for both factors mainly through simulation, Segue shows potential improvement in QoE.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1540,\+ clear writing with a precise description of the problem and solution,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1541,\- brute-force and simulation-based solution lacks insights and is not thought-provoking,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1542,\- missing baselines from prior work in evaluation,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1543,Thank you for submitting your work to JSys! This paper has almost impeccable writing and is truly enjoyable to read,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1544,The proposed method is easy to understand and appears beneficial to QoE.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1545,"That said, I am not so sure about the statements in the paper claiming that it ""frames a new direction"" or  ""sets off a new thread"" for ABR streaming and offline chunking",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1546,"Both aspects that constitute Segue -- segmentation and augmentation -- have been studied before, with the prominent effort originating from Netflix and in the industry as engineering innovations.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1547,"Regarding segmentation, Netflix documented a method called ""per-shot encode optimization,"" as mentioned in Section 2.2",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1548,"However, the authors seem to have misunderstood its mechanism by incorrectly stating that each quality level comprises a number of ""fixed-length"" segments",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1549,"In fact, the initial version of their method -- according to Netflix's blog [18] -- chunks a video at boundaries of ""shots,"" each containing a *variable* length of the video",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1550,"A subsequent [blog](https://netflixtechblog.com/optimized-shot-based-encodes-now-streaming-4b9464204830) further introduced ""shot collation"" that merges multiple shots into a single chunk, bearing the same spirit as Segue (for a purpose different from QoE optimization though).",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1551,"As for augmentation, this paper also mentioned the ""per-title encode optimization"" technique shipped by Netflix years ago, so the only differentiator of Segue on this front is selectively augmenting parts of a video, which sounds like more of a marginal revision than a new ""direction"" or ""thread."" In fact, Segue's unique dependence on playback context and ABR algorithm only manifests through basic simulation.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1552,One side effect of positioning itself as a unique direction is that the paper misses baselines from prior work in evaluation.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1553,"- Segmentation: Prior work [9, 29, 33] is considered orthogonal to Segue, but what if merging two fragments into a chunk and converting the second keyframe as an inter-frame actually improves the coding efficiency? This will apparently lead to strictly better results (same chunk length with a smaller size) and would reduce (and improve) Segue to the same domain as prior work.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1554,"- Augmentation: A naive baseline can be adding one or more additional tracks to the bitrate ladder, which can be used to evaluate Segue's effectiveness and savings (for not encoding and storing the extra tracks)",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1555,"Similarly, although prior work [22, 31] pursues the opposite of Segue, they simply navigate the same tradeoff space by being more generous on the number of tracks, and can also serve as baselines.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1556,"Putting the above concern aside, Segue's solution does not seem very novel or inspirational to future work",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1557,"Brute force and simulation are the most straightforward way that one could approach the outlined problems, not providing many insights to the readers",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1558,"If Segue could practically deploy and prove its usefulness, the proposed method could be of great engineering value; otherwise, Segue would probably become more ready to publish if it leveraged more interesting insights in its solution, e.g., the interaction between Segue and ABR.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1559,"To make my review more suggestive, here is a possible next step to begin with",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1560,"In Section 4.1, multiple intuitive heuristics have been defined and associated with penalties",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1561,"Instead of exhaustively enumerating $2^k$ outcomes, can you try the dynamic programming algorithm below off the top of my head? I hope I am not missing something.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1562,"Define $P(i)$ as the lowest penalty achieved by segmenting the first $i$ keyframes as chunks, and $C(j, i)$ as the per-chunk cost of merging keyframes $j, j+1, \ldots, i, 1 \le j \le i$ into a chunk -- whether the cost is defined using time, bytes, or time and bytes",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1563,"Then $P(i) = \min \\{ P(j-1) + C(j, i) \\}, 1\le j \le i$",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1564,"Given a maximum chunk length, only a small number of $j$s are required to be enumerated and the per-chunk cost table can be pre-computed, so the actual time complexity is close to $O(N)$",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1565,"Even so, it remains a question as to how segmentation and augmentation could optimize a more sophisticated QoE function given an ABR algorithm without blindly relying on simulation.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1566,"Additionally, I am not fully convinced about which segments are more ""vulnerable"" (besides chunks being overly large): If I were allowed to modify the traces used in the paper arbitrarily, I could choose to increase the instantaneous bandwidth before streaming the ""vulnerable"" segments such that they are no longer ""vulnerable."" In other words, bandwidth fluctuation seems to play some fundamental role in offline optimization, but it has not been explored by the paper and could even undermine its findings.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1567,"- As mentioned above, [18] actually uses ""variable-length"" segments.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1568,"- Why is S30 more likely to incur rebuffering than a higher-bitrate chunk S37? Chunks prior to S30 do not look more ""challenging"" than those before S37",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1569,The playback context dependence does not seem to be explained in detail by the paper.,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1570,"- Nit: ""We describe three augmentation functions"": should be ""four"" and $\lambda_v$ is missing.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1571,The paper investigates co-designing encoding and bitrate adaptation for video streaming applications,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1572,"It argues that existing practice, where videos are segmented into chunks of fixed duration, misses opportunities to optimize QoE further",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1573,"More specifically, the paper shows that chunks with complex scenes require higher bit rates and are more vulnerable to QoE degradations (e.g., rebuffering)",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1574,It further argues that using variable-length chunks (segmentation) and more bit rates for complex scenes (augmentation) provides more knobs to optimize user QoE,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1575,It formulates the relevant optimization problem and uses simulation-based experiments to quantify QoE improvements for different videos and network conditions,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1576,Thank you for submitting your paper to JSys,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1577,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading your paper, and I learned a lot in the process",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1578,"I think the idea of co-designing encoding and adaptation, especially for low-bandwidth networks, is timely and innovative and advances the state-of-the-art in the area.",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1579,- The idea to co-design encoding and adaptation is well-motivated,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1580," The paper does an excellent job of illustrating why fixed-duration chunks leave a lot desired from a QoE optimization perspective, especially for low-bandwidth networks",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1581,- The evaluation does a good job demonstrating the value of new(ish) QoE optimization knobs,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1582,"- Though the writing, in general, is good, it is hard to follow at times",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1583,"For example, the illustrative example in Figure 1 is quite critical to the story",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1584,"However, it took me a while to grasp the key idea",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1585,The section had a few forward references and many moving parts that made it difficult to follow the narrative,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1586,"To illustrate, the first paragraph in Section 3 says, “Using two rate adaptation algorithms, …” — which two algorithms? Where is the explanation for red/green shades in Figures 1b and 1c? Where can I find an explanation for the difference between 1c and 1d (is there any reference for 1d?)? I am not sure what is a bitrate track here; is it the same as a resolution? ",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1587,- More elaborate discussion on challenges with the proposed scheme is needed,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1588,My first reaction is that the choice of fixed-duration chunks has a lot to do with operational simplicity,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1589,NetFlix’s interest in looking beyond naive fixed-duration chunks hints at the operational value of variable-length chunk boundaries,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1590,"However, the cost of enabling such dynamism in video encoding is still unclear",iUU6Qr3eQd6
1591,Where does the proposed approach lie in that design spectrum? The paper does have a cursory discussion on this issue,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1592,I will encourage the authors to add a more in-depth discussion on this issue,iUU6Qr3eQd6
1593,This paper has the noble aim of  understanding the requirements of reproducibility for ML applications and to assess the,v-6XBItNld2
1594,reproducibility support of existing ML lifecycle management systems,v-6XBItNld2
1595,"Although the word ""systems"" is mentioned, its use here strongly suggests software engineering as opposed to traditional computing systems",v-6XBItNld2
1596,"That editorial concern aside, it is clear that machine learning is becoming an increasing part of what we do in systems research in general, so I will proceed with the assumption of this being in scope.",v-6XBItNld2
1597,"Overall, I found this paper to be fairly well-written",v-6XBItNld2
1598,"Throughout the text, however, I feel that more use of active voice would make the paper read a bit stronger",v-6XBItNld2
1599,So I would ask the authors to please consider an editorial to make the writing a bit more active--and a bit tighter as well,v-6XBItNld2
1600,"The abstract, or example, is a bit too long",v-6XBItNld2
1601,"I also think the ""Research Agenda"" is a bit inappropriate for a technical paper",v-6XBItNld2
1602,"This makes the paper conclude more like a proposal when, in fact, there has been substantial scholarly effort leading into this section",v-6XBItNld2
1603,"Consider significantly shortening this section or removing it, unless it is really contributing to the contributions of the paper.",v-6XBItNld2
1604,"Regarding the motivation for the paper, there are few points that could be sharpened:",v-6XBItNld2
1605,"The authors claim (with citation) that ""ML model creation is experimentation-based, making it an ad-hoc process with frequent jumps between the different lifecycle phases""",v-6XBItNld2
1606,I'm not sure this statement is true and certainly will benefit from a clear example/examplar that supports this claim,v-6XBItNld2
1607,"As someone who works with ML codes (mostly in the Computer Vision space), we see projects that are much more like typical software development lifecycles, since they often result in proper software releases and tools",v-6XBItNld2
1608,It might be beneficial for the authors to be more clear about the actual types of ML projects they are considering as part of this study (and which are being left out),v-6XBItNld2
1609,"Later in the same paragraph, the authors state, ""As a result, existing software engineering methodologies and best practices cannot be directly applied."" I don't agree with this statement either",v-6XBItNld2
1610,"We already know that agile methods (outside of the ML space) also jump freely between lifecycle stages, so it would seem at first blush like the same limitations apply to many other types of software projects.",v-6XBItNld2
1611,"The authors state, ""To prevent an impending reproducibility crisis [23, 25, 49], both research and industry have spent significant effort on trying to incorporate reproducibility as a first-class citizen into the lifecycle management systems."" Given that one of the projects cited is TensorFlow, the authors may wish to be aware of the TensorFlow Models Garden effort at Google, https://github.com/tensorflow/models and an experience report at https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00821v1.",v-6XBItNld2
1612,I really like the discussion of artifacts in section 3.1,v-6XBItNld2
1613,"But I found myself wondering, why isn't any technical report or paper describing an ML Project not an artifact, too",v-6XBItNld2
1614," For many projects, we have observed that the paper often amounts to the equivalent of a ""requirements document"" that describes what the model is supposed to do and how it does it",v-6XBItNld2
1615,Could it be that many ML projects amount to being part of a general class of research software that is often linked to a paper or set of papers? We have observed this in many NLP and CV projects.,v-6XBItNld2
1616,"Overall, I find the study to be well-constructed",v-6XBItNld2
1617,"However, I did find myself wondering whether the study itself is reproducible",v-6XBItNld2
1618,This is an anonymous submission but it would be nice to know more about the methods used and whether any tools/datasets are being made available to the community to reproduce or extend these efforts,v-6XBItNld2
1619," If this paper is accepted, I hope the authors can speak more directly about how reproducible this study actually is and what tools/scripts/datasets will be made available to the community.",v-6XBItNld2
1620,"In closing, there are some flaws in this paper but most can probably be addressed with routine revisions",v-6XBItNld2
1621," This work is definitely worthy of attention in the software engineering community and, although a bit of a stretch for systems, probably has a home in JSys.",v-6XBItNld2
1622,"The paper proposes a framework for evaluating the reproducibility capabilities of ML tools, applies the framework to 12 popular ML lifecycle management tools, and provides a set of observations and research challenges.",v-6XBItNld2
1623,The paper is well-written and easy to follow,v-6XBItNld2
1624,It has the potential to be a valuable paper,v-6XBItNld2
1625,"However, it needs a significant amount of additional work.",v-6XBItNld2
1626,Here are my comments and suggestions on how to improve the paper.,v-6XBItNld2
1627,* Output data and metrics - The point of reproducibility research space is that these outputs can be recreated,v-6XBItNld2
1628,"These artifacts are not “essential for achieving reproducibility”, but can be considered essential for “verifying reproducibility”",v-6XBItNld2
1629,"Even, reproducibility can be verified with just a fraction of those outputs (in case they are large in volume)",v-6XBItNld2
1630,"If the focus on the paper is to “achieve reproducibility” then these two should be excluded from the artifacts, however, if the focus is to “verify or evaluate reproducibility” these two can remain in the list -- but more information needs to be added in case these are large in size",v-6XBItNld2
1631,"* Software dependencies - these dependencies should include software itself and necessary packages (e.g., Python and NumPy)",v-6XBItNld2
1632,"In other words, add that dependencies include the software itself, which is now missing",v-6XBItNld2
1633,"* Experiment - Consider renaming this to “Computational workflow”, and update the language in the paragraph.",v-6XBItNld2
1634,* Don’t use “achieve perfect reproducibility” as reproducibility is already binary (either something is reproducible or it is not),v-6XBItNld2
1635,Change this to “to enable reproducibility” or “to verify reproducibility” or “evaluate reproducibility”,v-6XBItNld2
1636,"If you’d like to introduce nuance in reproducibility, you should add a definition on partial reproducibility and a reproducibility range in 2.2",v-6XBItNld2
1637,Table 1: add what each letter means in the table caption ,v-6XBItNld2
1638,Creating the experiment and reproducing the experiment parts should be divided,v-6XBItNld2
1639,"Also it seems that both versions (light blue and light yellow) are fetched at the same time, is this intentional? It is unclear what “automation” is in this figure.",v-6XBItNld2
1640,* It would be helpful for the reader to see a bullet list of each of the projects with a 1-2 sentence description (as many will not be familiar with at least some of the tools),v-6XBItNld2
1641,Can these systems be used with each other or they serve the same purpose? ,v-6XBItNld2
1642,"* Table 3 is the essence of the paper, yet it is not very informative",v-6XBItNld2
1643,"I suggest sorting the tools from best to worst, adding a rating based on its popularity (ie GitHub stars, or no of contributors), maybe a comment, and setting it to landscape",v-6XBItNld2
1644,That way a reader can immediately see which tool has the best reproducibility support.,v-6XBItNld2
1645,* The observations are somewhat in contradiction to the results presented in the table.,v-6XBItNld2
1646,"* Observation 1 is a bit arbitrary and vague (ie, all systems have some versioning)",v-6XBItNld2
1647,I suggest removing it and instead adding a project description for each project and a conclusion pointing out which systems are best for reproducibility,v-6XBItNld2
1648,"* Observation 2 - do the tools have integration/support for git? If so, they don’t need to ‘reinvent the wheel’ and implement their own versioning",v-6XBItNld2
1649,Also I wouldn’t say that full versioning is rare given that there are many “Vs” in Tab 3,v-6XBItNld2
1650,* Observations 3 and 4 are critical,v-6XBItNld2
1651,"Putting higher emphasis on them would be good and also adding in Tab 3 if the tools support dependency capture, containers, VMs",v-6XBItNld2
1652,It is also important to note that Python based platforms can use built in dependency capture,v-6XBItNld2
1653,Would that be possible for the rest of the platforms? ,v-6XBItNld2
1654,Continuous integration (CI) allows testing a ML workflow on various software versions and systems seamlessly,v-6XBItNld2
1655,"I expect any of these systems can be tested with CI, so I don’t agree with this observation",v-6XBItNld2
1656,"Also, I don’t understand why would one want to “export experiments to a different environment”, when the original one can be exported or encapsulated into a virtual container",v-6XBItNld2
1657,"Also, “different types of reproducibility” sounds very odd",v-6XBItNld2
1658,"* Observation 6 is vague (“similar but different” sounds unscientific), and it should be removed",v-6XBItNld2
1659,The first sentence is in contradiction with Observation 1,v-6XBItNld2
1660,The main points from this observation can be added to the description of each tool.,v-6XBItNld2
1661,* Observation 7 is essentially saying that the presented methodology is bad,v-6XBItNld2
1662,"Some of the points here may be true, but the fact that “classification is difficult and messy at times” just showcases the flaws in the methodology",v-6XBItNld2
1663,"If the paper is to be resubmitted, this observation should be removed and difficulties of classification should be discussion elsewhere.",v-6XBItNld2
1664,* The Framework extensions section is not very convincing,v-6XBItNld2
1665,"* The “Entire Lifecycle” points to a major flaw of the methodology, which is that the paper only evaluates the “experimentation phase of the ML lifecycle”",v-6XBItNld2
1666,I don’t think that is the case,v-6XBItNld2
1667,"First, I don’t see why the same observations and reproducibility metrics cannot be applied to the development phase of the ML process",v-6XBItNld2
1668,"Second, I don’t understand why one would measure reproducibility of a model in the operation phase unless that model is not updated in real time",v-6XBItNld2
1669,This paper uses “reproducibility” where it should just use code/model “testing”,v-6XBItNld2
1670,"Further, does any of the systems support/encourage/enforce code testing? ",v-6XBItNld2
1671,"* The “Scalability” subsection doesn’t actually speak about the system scalability, but stand-alone parts of the ML lifecycle that are not incorporated as part of the main flow.",v-6XBItNld2
1672,* “Reasoning” is not very convincing,v-6XBItNld2
1673,Surely all systems support process/model/code documentation?,v-6XBItNld2
1674,"* “Sensitivity” has a misleading name, and it points to the bad methodology (ie “we do not yet understand how important each of the artifacts is individually”)",v-6XBItNld2
1675,"* There is no space after a full stop and a capital letter in several places, ie, 2.1 first paragraph “.E”",v-6XBItNld2
1676,* python -> Python with capital P,v-6XBItNld2
1677,"The authors have reasonably defined reproducibility, identified artifacts that during ML lifecycle that directly affect reproducibility, and have proposed a framework for categorizing system support for reproducibility",v-6XBItNld2
1678,"Using this framework, the authors presented a systematic survey on the support status of mainstream tools, and from which they found generally good reproducibility support with rooms to improve, including hardware dependency tracking and interoperability.",v-6XBItNld2
1679,"While I think the authors did a reasonably comprehensive job in covering the major aspects of reproducibility, I would like to add a few points for consideration/discussion.",v-6XBItNld2
1680,"Model throughput reproducibility? In production settings we look at two major metrics: accuracy and throughput, and the later is needed for business purposes, for example: we need this inference to be done within 100ms before the user gets impatient",v-6XBItNld2
1681,"Thus, during the design stage we expect the model to hit XYZ queries/s, we would like it to hit a similar QPS of XYZ in production setting, and it will be highly desirable to capture the runtime performance aspect of ML training;",v-6XBItNld2
1682,"Run to run variance? in ML we often tolerate a small run to run variance, and I think it would be important to explicitly consider this, as the strictest sense of reproducibility does not and need not apply",v-6XBItNld2
1683,"This variance can stem from random initialization, random optimizer walk, asynchronous updates, and the order with which the data is fed",v-6XBItNld2
1684,How would a perfect tool accommodate to this?,v-6XBItNld2
1685,- 2.1: white space after dot,v-6XBItNld2
1686,- 4.2 One one end -> on one end,v-6XBItNld2
1687,"Disclaimer on expertise: While I am actively publishing in the area of continual/lifelong machine learning, I am not very familiar with state-of-the-art reproducibility systems and the tools presented in this paper.",v-6XBItNld2
1688,This paper presents a framework to compare management systems for machine learning (ML) code and data in terms of versioning and automation capabilities,v-6XBItNld2
1689,These two aspects are critical to making ML systems more reliable to reproduce,v-6XBItNld2
1690,"The paper provides a solid overview of a typical ML workflow, ML artifacts, and differences between repeatability, reproducibility, and replicability and considers a large number of systems as candidates for their framework",v-6XBItNld2
1691,"In the end, it finds that 12 systems out of all candidates in some way aim to assist reproducibility and compares them as follows: whether they only store nothing, single snapshots, or full version histories for the different artifacts; and whether they allow automating creating/publishing/fetching/executing the artifacts",v-6XBItNld2
1692,"Finally, the paper presents ideas to continue the analysis of these tools as well as some points that could be part of a future research agenda for ML reproducibility.",v-6XBItNld2
1693,"- The paper highlights the important challenge of reproducibility of ML, and why this goes beyond just the code.",v-6XBItNld2
1694,- The list of ML artifacts and the potential versioning/automation capabilities are comprehensive,v-6XBItNld2
1695,- The paper points out the need for standardization.,v-6XBItNld2
1696,"- The actual analysis of tools is rather shallow, the paper only reports whether a tool checks a certain box or not, and does not provide much-needed detail into *how* a tool implements these capabilities, which in my opinion would be essential to decide between tools.",v-6XBItNld2
1697,"- The paper does not motivate the benefits of specialized tools for versioning and automation, in particular, what these tools provide compared to a ""tried and prove"" pipeline consisting of version control with git and continuous integration/deployment.",v-6XBItNld2
1698,"- The future research agenda is highly idealized and fails to fully convey the complexity of some of the raised tasks, e.g",v-6XBItNld2
1699,how difficult it is to capture the sensitivity of ML models to input data.,v-6XBItNld2
1700,- The paper lacks any discussion of the limitations of such a framework,v-6XBItNld2
1701,"I feel it would benefit greatly from a better differentiation from other frameworks and discuss what the framework should do, and what it should *not* do.",v-6XBItNld2
1702,"Thank you for submitting this paper, which I believe highlights an important need for more thorough versioning and standardization.",v-6XBItNld2
1703,"However, I believe that in the current state, this paper is rather shallow and I feel it would benefit from a more clear separation from other frameworks (e.g",v-6XBItNld2
1704,for deployment in a large-scale environment) and using that space for more detailed insights into the compared tools.,v-6XBItNld2
1705,"In particular, I feel that many of the points raised in 5.1 should already be addressed in this work.",v-6XBItNld2
1706,"Secondly, I believe many points raised in the research agenda are active research fields, and a more insightful comparison would be beneficial to clarify the position of this framework in the larger context of ML research.",v-6XBItNld2
1707,3.2: What are the benefits for versioning/automation of such tools compared to simply git+CI/CD? Can you provide a more detailed description of what these tools *do to help?*,v-6XBItNld2
1708,"4.2, Observation 3 (automatic dependency discovery): I am unconvinced of the actual benefits of discovering software dependencies compared to using docker images; I rather believe that using docker images is a strictly more powerful approach",v-6XBItNld2
1709,"Docker separates the dependencies of the host system from the container (all we need to know from the host are the kernel and docker version), reducing interference",v-6XBItNld2
1710,"Furthermore, only capturing libraries and version numbers often is not enough: What if libraries need to be configured properly? Or do not work if another library is installed? A docker image contains all these interactions in an isolated environment that can also be versioned easily (as a simple dockerfile specifies the image).",v-6XBItNld2
1711,"5.1, (user experience): I believe addressing the user experience (ease of version and automation) of each tool in this work would make this framework much more valuable, and I feel it should be addressed in this paper already.",v-6XBItNld2
1712,"5.1, (performance & benchmarking): It seems to me that the performance overhead of a (useful) versioning framework should be negligible",v-6XBItNld2
1713,"The main requirements for computational resources (training, eval, ...) seem orthogonal to how exactly the artifacts are versioned",v-6XBItNld2
1714,"Maybe it would make sense to plot the framework overhead for different artifact counts and sizes, but this could already be addressed by this paper without a user study and using random artifacts.",v-6XBItNld2
1715,5.2: I question whether a single framework should attempt to capture everything,v-6XBItNld2

1734,Summary : This paper presents an algorithm to schedule Real-time periodic tasks that are expressed as pipelines,icP8jy6ayy8
1735,The Real-time requirements here include end-to-end (E2E) delay and loss-rate guarantee of the pipeline,icP8jy6ayy8
1736,The algorithm returns the budgets and periods that each of the tasks get during runtime at every stage of the pipeline,icP8jy6ayy8
1737,The resulting tasks with the budgets and period can the be scheduled asynchronously and without any data dependencies among them.,icP8jy6ayy8
1738,The paper also has takes another step forward and maps tasks to a Multiprocessor platform,icP8jy6ayy8
1739,The tasks are mapped to processors using a heuristic,icP8jy6ayy8
1740,"For dynamic pipelines, it also does - (a) runtime task migration  and (b)scheduling parameter optimization",icP8jy6ayy8
1741,"- The system model is well-presented,",icP8jy6ayy8
1742,- Visualizations of the algorithm operation provided improve the readability of the paper.,icP8jy6ayy8
1743,- Reduction of utilization for already accepted task pipelines when mapping to multi-processor fails is a tradeoff between end-to-end delay and utilization,icP8jy6ayy8
1744,- Comparison with state of the art solvers that support integer non-linear programming is well-presented,icP8jy6ayy8
1745,"- The paper has released its artifacts with a good README file, kudos to the authors",icP8jy6ayy8
1746,"- Pipelines are common in sensing-actuation chains as seen in automotive and avionics systems, and applications such as ROS can use CoPi to predictably schedule pipelines using this scheme",icP8jy6ayy8
1747,"- The schedulability used in RMS for single processor and partitioned RMS for multiple processor, so the utilization is still bounded by the theoretical limits of RMS.",icP8jy6ayy8
1748,"- The disadvantage of scaling the period and adjusting the computation time can lead to increased memory requirements of buffers between tasks, the overhead of which is not presented",icP8jy6ayy8
1749,- the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are empirically determined with no application mentioned for reference,icP8jy6ayy8
1750,"- Task assignment and migration on multiprocessor can be made practical by considering the system implementation details, but these have elided",icP8jy6ayy8
1751,- Why is LBG (Latency Bandwidth Gap) plotted only for values between 10 and 15? It would be useful if the authors can discuss this.,icP8jy6ayy8
1752,- Why does the loss rate = 25% lead to loss of performance of CoPi (Fig 8b)? This can be discussed in camera-ready,icP8jy6ayy8
1753,"- The authors mention about integrating the framework into a Multi-core OS and into the ROS middleware, these will greatly enhance the impact of this work.",icP8jy6ayy8
1754,"Paper summary: Embedded applications consists of one or more sensor-to-actuation pipelines, e.g., object perception pipelines in autonomous vehicle systems",icP8jy6ayy8
1755,These pipelines are typically modelled as multiple data-dependent tasks (or processes),icP8jy6ayy8
1756,They have strict end-to-end (E2E) constraints because of the cyber-physical nature of such applications,icP8jy6ayy8
1757,"Additionally, the pipelines may also have constraints on the end-to-end sampling rates, which determine the quality of service provided",icP8jy6ayy8
1758,"When deploying such pipelines on multiprocessor embedded platforms, mapping the tasks to appropriate scheduling policy, parameters, cores such that the constraints are satisfied is known to be an NP-hard problem, even if the the workload is known in advance (as is the case in many embedded applications)",icP8jy6ayy8
1759,"While prior works have proposed to use constraint solvers to come up with a satisfiable task schedule, these are slow, especially when the workload changes at runtime and new schedules are desired at runtime, This paper proposes a heuristic-based algorithm instead — CoPi — that maps the pipeline to independent tasks and data buffers, and uses rate-monotonic scheduling to come up with a set of feasible schedule",icP8jy6ayy8
1760,"CoPi is evaluated against open-source constraint solvers like GEKKO, pyomo, and scipy using pipelines with synthetic parameters",icP8jy6ayy8
1761,"While it is slightly worse than GEKKO in terms of scheduling capabilities, it finds a solution much faster than GEKKO.",icP8jy6ayy8
1762,"Dear authors, thank you for submitting your paper to JSys! Thank you also for anonymously sharing the CoPi source!",icP8jy6ayy8
1763,The paper is written well; the CoPI algorithm is particularly nicely explained,icP8jy6ayy8
1764,"I believe CoPi can be very useful in many modern-day embedded applications and it also has the potential to be used for applications outside the embedded systems domain, e.g., datacenter systems with QoS constraints",icP8jy6ayy8
1765,The paper also presents an extensive evaluation for CoPi against open-source baselines for a large parameter space,icP8jy6ayy8
1766,"My main concern is that the paper does not demonstrate the use of CoPi for any real-world applications, i.e., there are no case studies using realistic workloads",icP8jy6ayy8
1767,"In the absence of such case studies, I expect that at least the constraints are directly derived from real-world applications",icP8jy6ayy8
1768,"While this may be the case, this is not apparent from the paper",icP8jy6ayy8
1769,"For example, the paper currently does not sufficiently show if runtime scheduling is a problem in applications and if yes how does a certain scheduling delay fit within the overall scheme of things",icP8jy6ayy8
1770,"In the following, I summarize the strengths and weaknesses of the paper in brief, followed by detailed comments.",icP8jy6ayy8
1771,+ The problem is relevant for many modern embedded applications,icP8jy6ayy8
1772,"+ Given the QoS constraints in many datacenter applications today, the paper also highlights possible design choices for scheduling in datacenter systems",icP8jy6ayy8
1773,"+ The solution is explained clearly with underlying formalism, wherever needed",icP8jy6ayy8
1774,+ The solution is evaluated extensively against multiple open-source constraint solvers and shown to outperform them in terms of scheduling capabilities and/or speed,icP8jy6ayy8
1775,"+ Overall, the solution seems to be simple and intuitive, and easily deployable in practical systems",icP8jy6ayy8
1776,"- CoPi is motivated from real-world pipelines, but the paper does not demonstrate the use of CoPi for a real-world application",icP8jy6ayy8
1777,"- While runtime scheduling is a motivation, the paper does not delve deeper into such examples from real-world applications, neither does it show what types of constraints exist in practical systems",icP8jy6ayy8
1778,- There seems to be an unnecessary emphasis on loss rates in the early part of the paper,icP8jy6ayy8
1779,- The paper assumes the reader is familiar with many concepts from real-time systems literature,icP8jy6ayy8
1780,* The phrase “loss-rate” is used multiple times in the Introduction and Abstract,icP8jy6ayy8
1781,"However, despite being familiar with the real-time systems literature, I had a hard time understanding the exact meaning of this phrase",icP8jy6ayy8
1782,I suggest the meaning is clarified once in the beginning itself.,icP8jy6ayy8
1783,"* The paper never really explains why the design avoids timing and data dependencies, and what does asynchronous scheduling mean (as opposed to synchronous scheduling before)",icP8jy6ayy8
1784,"I personally understand the intuition and the rationale, but it may not be obvious to all readers, especially when reading the following sentences in the introduction",icP8jy6ayy8
1785,"“The main idea behind CoPi is to get rid of the unnecessary delay and message losses in a pipeline, and consequently avoiding the timing and data dependencies between the communicating tasks [21].”, “As CoPi meets the E2E delay and loss-rate guarantees of a pipeline, the tasks are asynchronously scheduled without any timing or data dependencies between each other.” ",icP8jy6ayy8
1786,"* Explain the WFD heuristic and the Simpson's four-slot algorithm in brief, maybe in footnotes.",icP8jy6ayy8
1787,"* “We show that CoPi performs significantly better, an order of magnitude at the highest, in runtime, and comparably in acceptance ratio, with respect to other solvers.” Simplify this statement",icP8jy6ayy8
1788,"* “Without the loss of generality, we consider unidirectional pipelines.” Please elaborate",icP8jy6ayy8
1789,* Could you cite examples where L (loss rate) is an input parameter of the system?,icP8jy6ayy8
1790,"* “If a task has already finished its work for a job invocation, it yields and does not start its next job until next period.” When and why does this happen?",icP8jy6ayy8
1791,"* “Moreover, the fixed execution strategy tightly bounds a pipeline’s end-to-end latency [26].” What does a fixed execution strategy mean?",icP8jy6ayy8
1792,* I realize the Equation 1 is derived from prior work,icP8jy6ayy8
1793,I would still prefer to read about how it is derived in this paper,icP8jy6ayy8
1794,"“As Equation 1 is a recursive equation, the computation time depends on the wanted precision on E.” Why is the equation recursive? Is it because Ri’s are unknown? The LHS E does not feature on the RHS.",icP8jy6ayy8
1795,"* “Aligned with Feiertag et al.’s concept of data-path reachability conditions [21], the ratio of non-reachable messages to the total number of messages is the loss-rate of a pipeline.” I found this reference unnecessarily confusing",icP8jy6ayy8
1796,Reachability conditions can be interpreted as something completely different.,icP8jy6ayy8
1797,"* At the beginning of Section 3.2, it was unclear whether loss rate refers to only messages that are input to the source task, or to all tasks.",icP8jy6ayy8
1798,* Does the ratio in Equation 4 also hold if the two tasks are not started synchronously? Does this equation represent an upper or lower bound on the sampling ratio?,icP8jy6ayy8
1799,"* “Then, the loss-rate of a producer-consumer pair is …” I think the example in this sentence is wrong",icP8jy6ayy8
1800,* I think Section 3.2.1 can be significantly shortened,icP8jy6ayy8
1801,"Particularly, the proofs in the section are really just explanations",icP8jy6ayy8
1802,"I suggest keeping the rules as they are, but getting rid of the proofs, and weaving the explanations along with the examples, which are most helpful in understanding the concepts.",icP8jy6ayy8
1803,* “This problem is known to be NP-hard [29].” Citations [29] is a general paper on nonlinear integer programming,icP8jy6ayy8
1804,Could you also cite a paper from the real-time systems literature,icP8jy6ayy8
1805,"Recently, many papers have proposed precise complexity classes for different problems in the RTS domain",icP8jy6ayy8
1806,"Could you cite one of these papers, if applicable?",icP8jy6ayy8
1807,* The rationale for budget adjustment was not clear in Section 4.1,icP8jy6ayy8
1808,It became clear in Section 5 later.,icP8jy6ayy8
1809,"* In equations 9 and 10, M is used as multiplier, but in the paragraph earlier, K is used.",icP8jy6ayy8
1810,"also proposed a similar approach of deriving task periods, offsets and other parameters from the end-to-end constraints, albeit on task precedence relations [23].” How are task precedence relations different from the dependencies considered in the paper?",icP8jy6ayy8
1811,* Runtime migrations may affect the budget parameter C,icP8jy6ayy8
1812,The paper currently does not comment on this aspect.,icP8jy6ayy8
1813,* “CoPi takes the initial task runtime budgets (C in the model and budgets in Algorithm 1) and the desired upper bound on the end-to-end delay (EUB in the model and e2e_ub in Algorithm 1) as its inputs.” What about the upper bound on the loss rate?,icP8jy6ayy8
1814,"* “CoPi runs Stage 1 only once for a pipeline, but it runs Stage 2 and 3 multiple times with different $\alpha$ values.” Can we instead start with one large $\alpha$?",icP8jy6ayy8
1815,* Figure 9(c): it would be nice to also learn about how GEKKO’s runtime varies with the pipeline length.,icP8jy6ayy8
1816,"This paper deals with the scheduling problem for pipelined tasks, where there’s an overall end-to-end delay",icP8jy6ayy8
1817,"For each task in the (linear) execution order, new computation times and periods are derived for data-independent periodic subtasks that can be scheduled under traditional RM, so as to guarantee end-to-end delays and acceptable loss rates",icP8jy6ayy8
1818,"In simulation, the heuristic approach, called CoPi, outperforms MINLP solvers.",icP8jy6ayy8
1819,"In section 3.2 the authors write “Based on the relationships between the periods of all the producer-consumer pairs starting from the source to the sink task, the end-to-end loss rate of a pipeline is calculated.” This statement is pretty vague… the authors should explain how this computation is performed.",icP8jy6ayy8
1820,"Soon after equations 6,7,8 it’s stated that the problem is an integer nonlinear programming problem",icP8jy6ayy8
1821,"This is a bit unclear to me just from the equations, where max could be handled with integer constraints, but I do not see nonlinear arithmetic involved",icP8jy6ayy8
1822,Where specifically do the nonlinear terms come from,icP8jy6ayy8
1823,Is the difficulty of this problem that the periods and computation times are assumed to be integers? I suspect scheduler granularity is fine enough that real-valued solutions would be acceptable,icP8jy6ayy8
1824,In Section 5.1 the authors mention in [23] a similar method is used,icP8jy6ayy8
1825,"Further clarity could be provided on the differences between these two, or a comparison could be done in the evaluation with the method in [23].",icP8jy6ayy8
1826,"In section 6.1 dealing with migration overhead and table 5, it doesn’t seem like the cost of migrations is reflected anywhere in the scheduling algorithm, only that task migrations can be kept low with the proposed approach.",icP8jy6ayy8
1827,"In the evaluation in section 7, the approach is evaluated on 1000 randomly generated task pipelines",icP8jy6ayy8
1828,"How are these created and are they realistic? Evaluating realistic pipeline parameters would provide a better evaluation than random parameters, which can be misleading for an evaluation.",icP8jy6ayy8
1829,This paper presents delay and loss-rate aware scheduling of tasks in cause-effect pipeline chains,icP8jy6ayy8
1830,"The paper is pretty well-written, easy to follow, and solves a practical problem",icP8jy6ayy8
1831,The analytical formulations also seem rigorous,icP8jy6ayy8
1832,"However, there are two fundamental limitations of the paper",icP8jy6ayy8
1833,"First, the uniprocessor case: This is the classic design-time schedulability analysis",icP8jy6ayy8
1834,"While the analytical part is convincing, the evaluation results show CoPi performs very poorly, especially the lost rate bound <= 25%",icP8jy6ayy8
1835,"The authors need to justify the requirement of such a heuristic approach, given that state-of-the-art solvers can find a solution with a high acceptance rate",icP8jy6ayy8
1836,"Since this is a purely design-time test, the runtime overhead (e.g., Table 2) should not be an issue in this case.",icP8jy6ayy8
1837,"Second, the multiprocessor case: the way the paper is written, first, it seems the heuristic is about design-time analysis used in traditional real-time schedulability tests",icP8jy6ayy8
1838,"However, the authors then introduce the runtime pipeline optimization method (RPO) in Section 6.2, making the model less plausible and leaving many issues undiscussed",icP8jy6ayy8
1839,"For instance, (a) How often the Algorithm 2 will be executed and conduct RPO? (b) How will PRO be integrated into the real-time schedulers? (c) What are the criteria that trigger the new budget and periods?",icP8jy6ayy8
1840,"Further, the runtime for a pipeline of 10 tasks is as high as 60 ms in a general-purpose Core i5 laptop",icP8jy6ayy8
1841,"What type of real-time schedulers can tolerate 60 ms of delays at runtime? How will this significant overhead be feasible in embedded devices while retaining real-time guarantees if the scheduler needs to execute Algorithm 2 quite often to conduct RPO? In contrast, if RPO is not needed, traditional optimization solvers' timing overhead is not a problem",icP8jy6ayy8
1842,"Then, why should the designers use CoPi given that traditional solvers can result in better acceptance?",icP8jy6ayy8
1843,The paper is evaluated on simulations/synthetic workloads only,icP8jy6ayy8
1844,"The paper will be further strengthened if the authors include actual workload, case study, and an implementation/evaluation of Algorithm 2 in existing real-time schedulers",icP8jy6ayy8
1845,The simulation parameters are used without any justification,icP8jy6ayy8
1846,"For instance, why N=10? Why LGB in [13, 15]?",icP8jy6ayy8
1847,"For instance, ""Latecy"" in the x-axis of Fig 8a.",icP8jy6ayy8
1848,"Final comments: The scheduling problem addressed in this work is worth considering, and the paper has intellectual merit",icP8jy6ayy8
1849,The paper could be improved in the following ways:,icP8jy6ayy8
1850,"(a) For the uniprocessor case, the authors need to justify why such a heuristic approach is reasonable compared to existing MINLP solvers",icP8jy6ayy8
1851,"For instance, if the problem is NP-hard, the traditional solvers may break in certain conditions — the authors could analytically or experimentally show the efficacy of CoPi for such cases",icP8jy6ayy8
1852,"(b) For the multiprocessor case, address the issues mentioned above, and include the realistic implementation on existing schedulers",icP8jy6ayy8
1853,"For instance, in the Introduction, the authors mentioned that ROS uses such a pipeline-based model — how could the designers integrate algorithm 2 RPO techniques in a ROS chain? (c) The evaluation part should be improved",icP8jy6ayy8
1854," For example, the authors should also include a thorough evaluation with realistic workload/case-study/implementation on real hardware/real-time schedulers",icP8jy6ayy8
1855," Further, justifications of the parameters used in the simulations/experiments should be presented precisely",icP8jy6ayy8
1856,The paper presents the formulation and solution of a mixed integer non linear programming problem to determine the best periods for pipelines of tasks that share data with one another.,icP8jy6ayy8
1857,The paper is certainly not ready for publication:,icP8jy6ayy8
1858,"1) the relevance of the problem is not well explained,",icP8jy6ayy8
1859,"2) there is a lack of connection to any practical application,",icP8jy6ayy8
1860,3) the writing and presentation style is not up to standard.,icP8jy6ayy8
1861,"While the contribution is clear, I think it is certainly not enough for an invitation to resubmit.",icP8jy6ayy8
1862,"I believe the paper does not really succeed in showing the relevance of the problem that is solved: periods of tasks are usually selected based on characteristics of the tasks (e.g., in cyber-physical systems sensor periods, control periods, and actuation periods are selected based on the physics of the process to be controlled, rather than being optimisation variables that can be selected at will)",icP8jy6ayy8
1863,"Given that, I wonder what is an example of a real system where the period selection technique is useful.",icP8jy6ayy8
1864,"In terms of positioning and relevance, I would recommend taking a look at papers like ""Time-selective data fusion forin-network processing in ad hocwireless sensor networks"" (by Jaanus Kaugerand, Johannes Ehala, Leo Motus, and Jurgo-Soren Preden) and trying to model the sensor fusion algorithms presented in these papers with a pipeline",icP8jy6ayy8
1865,"I do understand that the problem solved is not the same and not necessarily limited to cyber-physical systems, but with the lack of an application example in the paper, this is what comes to mind",icP8jy6ayy8
1866,"In the paper, the authors present a sensing pipeline that can in principle be implemented with a chain (where sensor 1 passes data to sensor 2 and eventually sensor N passes data to a fusion algorithm)",icP8jy6ayy8
1867,"This will impose requirements on the end-to-end latency, but unfortunately it also imposes constraints and requirements on the period values.",icP8jy6ayy8
1868,"Another very general comment is the following: why splitting tasks makes more sense than having a single task that invokes in sequence the functions that do $\tau_1, \dots, \tau_N$? It seems like there is a point in merging the tasks in a single big task that is actually trying to complete the pipeline in sequence within the pipeline deadline/period",icP8jy6ayy8
1869,No task is being used by multiple pipelines so there is no task that cannot be merged without problems.,icP8jy6ayy8
1870,The writing in the entire paper is quite poor.,icP8jy6ayy8
1871,"For example, the very first sentence of Section 2.1, i.e., ""A task $\tau$ is a two-tuple $(C,T)$ and asynchronous."", is (already) problematic",icP8jy6ayy8
1872,What is a two-tuple? I suppose this means that a task is a tuple with two elements,icP8jy6ayy8
1873,"The same appears later with a pipeline being a ""four-tuple"".",icP8jy6ayy8
1874,"This said, there is an enormous confusion between derived characteristics and intrinsic characteristics",icP8jy6ayy8
1875,A pipeline is not a tuple with four elements,icP8jy6ayy8
1876,"The pipeline, as modeled in the paper, is completely described by a single element: a set of tasks (each task having its own characteristics)",icP8jy6ayy8
1877,"In fact, the cardinality of the set is $N$, hence $N$ is not part of the definition of the pipeline",icP8jy6ayy8
1878,"Even more important, given what is written in the paper $E$ and $L$ are fully defined once $S$ is known, and hence they do not belong to the definition of the pipeline.",icP8jy6ayy8
1879,The scheduling model also presents a set of problems,icP8jy6ayy8
1880,"The sporadic server abstraction (probably better described in ""An Application-Level Implementation of the Sporadic Server"" than in [48], both being technical reports) is NOT a rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm",icP8jy6ayy8
1881,The two objects are quite different and they are not related in the way the authors describe,icP8jy6ayy8
1882,"In a sporadic server, the priority of the task is dynamic and decreased when the task has completed its budget, hence this cannot be a rate-monotonic scheduling algorithm",icP8jy6ayy8
1883,"I do understand what the authors mean with the beginning of 2.3, but this needs to be fixed",icP8jy6ayy8
1884,"I also have a hard time seeing how using a sporadic server for periodic tasks would be the best choice (rather than e.g., a constant bandwidth server)",icP8jy6ayy8
1885,The RMS bound that is enforced also comes as a surprise as it it clearly too conservative given the model of computation that is chosen.,icP8jy6ayy8
1886,"At the end of 2.3, the paper reads ""Moreover, the fixed execution strategy tightly bounds a pipeline's end-to-end latency [26]."" - the formulation is [26] includes initial release offsets for the tasks, that are not considered in the current paper",icP8jy6ayy8
1887,There is therefore an inconsistency between the results taken from the literature and the model used in the paper.,icP8jy6ayy8
1888,This is also true for Equation (1),icP8jy6ayy8
1889,Paper [20] is the source of the equation,icP8jy6ayy8
1890,"However, Theorem 5.4 in [20] specifies that the quantity bounded is the reaction time and not the worst-case end-to-end delay (as used in the paper)",icP8jy6ayy8
1891,"This is different and the term $T_1$ is therefore not needed (it refers to the fact that an event may happen precisely at the time of the start of $\tau_1$ and not be detected at the start, hence the event would only be detected and correctly reacted upon with the following job of $\tau_1$).",icP8jy6ayy8
1892,"I also don't entirely follow the argument that leads to the transition from Equation (1) to Equation (2), which I think is quite poorly written",icP8jy6ayy8
1893,"I do understand the point, and the fact that the quantity on the right of equation (2) is now bigger than the right-hand-side of equation (1), and therefore this is still a valid upper bound, but this needs to be expressed quite a lot better than it currently is",icP8jy6ayy8
1894,"Furthermore, it would be good to add the (possibly acceptable) assumption that the worst case response time of each task is less than the period in the definition of the task characteristics",icP8jy6ayy8
1895,"I think this assumption, while acceptable, is very limiting.",icP8jy6ayy8
1896,Another source of problems is the lack of the specification of a communication model,icP8jy6ayy8
1897,"The results in [20], for example, are derived for an implicit communication model (see the paragraph ""Communication Semantics"" just before Section 2.2 in the referred paper)",icP8jy6ayy8
1898,"In the absence of a communication model between tasks, it is quite hard to understand the results and their relevance.",icP8jy6ayy8
1899,The definition in Equation (3) is completely unacceptable,icP8jy6ayy8
1900,"While I understand what you mean with the sentence ""total lost output messages corresponding to the input messages"" and ""total input messages to a pipeline"", these two quantities do not mean anything if not properly defined",icP8jy6ayy8
1901,"In particular, to calculate the loss-rate there is a need to specify a time interval and the loss rate will necessarily be a function of the time interval",icP8jy6ayy8
1902,Section 3.2 does not resolve how to calculate the end-to-end loss-rate of a pipeline because it does not specify the time interval.,icP8jy6ayy8
1903,"What is calculated in Section 3.2.1 as the loss-rate is necessarily an average loss-rate over the entire execution of the tasks, but it is also important to understand and evaluate *which* events/messages are lost and which events are not.",icP8jy6ayy8
1904,"The sentence ""Therefore, the oversampling ratio: [...]"" lacks a verb",icP8jy6ayy8
1905,"The statement that when the producer has a larger period than the consumer there is no lost message in the pair is very obvious, as it is all the content of Section 3.2.1 in general",icP8jy6ayy8
1906,"Furthermore, the statements in the section are heavily dependent on the hypotesis that the initial release offset of tasks is zero for all the tasks, while the results used from the literature do not make that assumption",icP8jy6ayy8
1907,"In figure 3, the ratio between the period of $\tau_2$ and the period of $\tau_3$ is incorrect",icP8jy6ayy8
1908,"If the period of task $\tau_3$ is 50, for every output of task $\tau_2$ (every 200) there should be 4 outputs of $\tau_3$, so we should see ""1",icP8jy6ayy8
1909,"B"" four times, and then eventually ""3",icP8jy6ayy8
1910,"Similarly, in the text ""As $\tau_3$ runs twice frequently than $\tau_2$"" should be corrected.",icP8jy6ayy8
1911,"More in general, pages 4 and 5 can be significantly compressed as the statements (rules and examples) are very obvious",icP8jy6ayy8
1912,"Similarly, the description of the algorithm is too verbose for something that is very simple.",icP8jy6ayy8
1913,"Page 5: ""A task's runtime budget $C$ to read, process and write 1 message is usually determined by profiling its worst-case execution time (WCET)"" - the use of the word ""profiling"" here is very misleading",icP8jy6ayy8
1914,The WCET is usually an upper bound on the execution time of a task and is obtained using techniques like static analysis,icP8jy6ayy8
1915,"If one obtains it via profiling, it is not really certain that this is precisely the worst-case.",icP8jy6ayy8
1916,"Adjusting the budget using a constant $K$ may seem like a good idea, in principle, but take for example a control example: the pipeline here is composed of sensor, control, and actuator",icP8jy6ayy8
1917,"If we increase the budget of the control task with $K=2$, this means that we are trying to consider two different sensor messages in the same controller execution",icP8jy6ayy8
1918,"However, the result is that there is only one actuation command that can be applied at the end of the budget, and hence the two tasks would overlap",icP8jy6ayy8
1919,"More in general, once the budget of one task in the pipeline is inflated, this also has consequences on all the tasks that are connected to it in the pipeline",icP8jy6ayy8
1920,"I don't see therefore how it is possible to calculate a ""per task"" $M_i$ as in Equation (9)",icP8jy6ayy8
1921,Is the new loss rate calculation taking into account the fact that tasks overwrite the same values and maybe the values are then not meaningful any longer?,icP8jy6ayy8
1922,"As a minor note, it is quite annoying that the same concept changes name (in Section 4.1 there is $K$ and then right after in Equation (9), $M_i$ appears).",icP8jy6ayy8
1923,"The paragraph that starts with ""Our heuristic constraint solver algorithm [...]"" is very unclear",icP8jy6ayy8
1924,"I don't really understand what this means, with two forward references and very little information.",icP8jy6ayy8
1925,"The evaluation is conducted with independent tasks while pipeline examples have been made available, for example in ""Real world automotive benchmarks for free"" (Simon Kramer, Dirk Ziegenbein, and Arne Hamann) or also the RTSS 2021 challenge (http://2021.rtss.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RTSS2021-Industry-Challenge-v2.pdf)",icP8jy6ayy8
1926,Overall the evaluation seems to be superficial and rather a comparison of different solvers than something that provides insights into the problem and solution.,icP8jy6ayy8
